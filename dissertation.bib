  abstract = {Developing policies to address lake eutrophication requires an understanding of the relative contribution of different nutrient sources and of how lake and catchment characteristics interact to mediate the source\textendash receptor pathway. We analysed total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) data for 101 New Zealand lakes and related these to land use and edaphic sources of phosphorus (P). We then analysed a sub-sample of lakes in agricultural catchments to investigate how lake and catchment variables influence the relationship between land use and in-lake nutrients. Following correction for the effect of co-variation amongst predictor variables, high producing grassland (intensive pasture) was the best predictor of TN and TP, accounting for 38.6\% and 41.0\% of variation, respectively. Exotic forestry and urban area accounted for a further 18.8\% and 3.6\% of variation in TP and TN, respectively. Soil P (representing naturally-occurring edaphic P) was negatively correlated with TP, owing to the confounding effect of pastoral land use. Lake and catchment morphology (zmax and lake : catchment area) and catchment connectivity (lake order) mediated the relationship between intensive pasture and in-lake nutrients. Mitigating eutrophication in New Zealand lakes requires action to reduce nutrient export from intensive pasture and quantifying P export from plantation forestry requires further consideration.},

  abstract = {The precise estimation of process effects in hydrological models requires applying models to large scales with extensive spatial variability in controlling factors. Despite progress in large-scale applications of hydrological models in conterminous United States (CONUS) river basins, spatial constraints in model parameters have prevented the interbasin sharing of data, complicating quantification of process effects and limiting the accuracy of model predictions and uncertainties. Hierarchical Bayesian methods enable data sharing between basins and the identification of the causes of model uncertainties, which can improve model accuracy and interpretability; however, computational inefficiencies have been an obstacle to their large-scale application. We used a new generation of Bayesian methods to develop a hierarchical version of a previous hybrid (statistical-mechanistic) SPAtially Referenced Regression On Watershed attributes model of long-term mean annual streamflow in the CONUS. We identified hierarchical (regional) variations in model coefficients and uncertainties and evaluated their effects on model accuracy and interpretability across diverse environments in 16 major CONUS regions. Hierarchical coefficients significantly improved spatial accuracy of model predictions, with the largest improvements in humid eastern regions, where uncertainties were approximately one third of those in arid western regions. Half of the coefficients varied regionally, with the largest variations in coefficients associated with water losses in streams and reservoirs. Our unraveling of the causes of model uncertainties identified a small latent process component of runoff that varies inversely with river size in most CONUS regions. Our study advances the use of hierarchical Bayesian methods to improve the predictive capabilities of hydrological models.},

The nutrient enrichment critical load for northeastern lakes ranged from 3.5 to 6.0 kg N per ha per year. The N acidification critical loads associated with episodic N pulses in waters with low values of acid neutralizing capacity were 4.0 kg N per ha per year (western) and 8.0 kg N per ha per year (northeastern). The empirical critical loads for N-caused acidification were difficult to determine because of a lack of observations in the West, and high sulfur deposition in the East. For both nutrient enrichment and acidification, the N critical load was a function of how atmospheric N deposition was determined.},

We used two climate change models and the mean of the ensemble of seven climate models (Ensemble Mean), a yield prediction model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool-Variable Source Area), and a farm economic model to estimate how climate change would affect yields and the costs of reducing nitrogen (N) loading in an agricultural subbasin of the Chesapeake Bay. We estimated costs of meeting water quality goals based on the reduction in farm net returns from limits on N loadings under historical and future climate scenarios. Estimated costs of meeting water quality goals increase under future climate for one of the two climate models and for the Ensemble Mean. Major reasons for increased costs are higher predicted N loading from crops and higher N loading reductions to be achieved under future climate. The farm meets N limits by eliminating wheat and reducing corn and soybean production as well as increased use of best management practices (BMPs) including Conservation Reserve Program. Researchers should analyze effects of climate change on the costs of meeting water quality goals using multiple climate change prediction models and considering possible crop substitutions as well as crop and livestock BMPs. Further research should consider how commodity market reactions to producers' choices under climate change affect costs of meeting water quality goals.},

To examine relationships between anthropogenic N inputs and riverine N export, we constructed budgets describing N inputs and losses for 16 catchments, which encompass a range of climatic variability and are major drainages to the coast of the North Atlantic Ocean along a latitudinal profile from Maine to Virginia. Using data from the early 1990's, we quantified inputs of N to each catchment from atmospheric deposition, application of nitrogenous fertilizers, biological nitrogen fixation, and import of N in agricultural products (food and feed). We compared these inputs with N losses from the system in riverine export. The importance of the relative sources varies widely by catchment and is related to land use. Net atmospheric deposition was the largest N source ({$>$}60\%) to the forested basins of northern New England (e.g. Penobscot and Kennebec); net import of N in food was the largest source of N to the more populated regions of southern New England (e.g. Charles \& Blackstone); and agricultural inputs were the dominant N sources in the Mid-Atlantic region (e.g. Schuylkill \& Potomac). Over the combined area of the catchments, net atmospheric deposition was the largest single source input (31\%), followed by net imports of N in food and feed (25\%), fixation in agricultural lands (24\%), fertilizer use (15\%), and fixation in forests (5\%).},

This work is further driven by practical issues such as licensing costs and data availability, which mean that not all data are readily accessible for all end users. This paper represents a first step towards quantifying the `value-added' to model predictions by using input data derived at three different scales: 50!50 m, 1!1 km and 5!5 km. Model runs using PIT were carried out against observed phosphorus water quality data from the River Start and River Gara, which are the main sub-catchments of Slapton Ley, a grade 1 National Nature Reserve in southwest England. Model runs for the main 46 km2 Slapton catchment were also undertaken. The results show that some improvement in the ability of the model to capture the observed water quality behaviour may be made by using higher resolution DEM data, though these improvements may be outweighed by the extra data processing and computational time. Conversely, model runs driven by the 5 km data demonstrate consistent under-prediction for all three test catchments, which is perhaps not surprising given the greater degree of averaging underlying datasets at this scale. Results from the 1 km datasets provide the best agreement with observed water quality data, and appear to provide the `best available' means of parameterising PIT at the national scale.},

Potential denitrification, however, was limited by insufficient lengths of saturated soil conditions in all three ecosystems, the supply of DOC in the agroecosystems, and the supply of nitrate N in the prairie. Based on available DOC and nitrate N, the maximum contribution of denitrification below the root zone in the agroecosystems was less than 25\% of the total amount of leached nitrate N and the probable contribution of denitrification was much less.},

In this study, land cover patterns and stocking rates were used as measures of agricultural development in two pasture and one native grassland catchment in New Zealand and were related to water quality in streams of various orders. The amount of pasture per subcatchment correlated well to total nitrogen and nitrate in one catchment and turbidity and total phosphorous in the other catchment. Stocking rates were only correlated to total phosphorous in one pasture catchment but showed stronger correlations to ammonium, total phosphorous and total nitrogen in the other pasture catchment. Winter and spring floods were significant sources of nutrients and faecal coliforms from one of the pasture catchments into a wetland complex. Nutrient and faecal coliform concentrations were better predicted by pastural land cover in fourth-order than in second-order streams. This suggests that upstream land use is more influential in larger streams, while local land use and other factors may be more important in smaller streams. These temporal and spatial scale effects indicate that water-monitoring schemes need to be scale-sensitive.},

We measured 31 hydrologic, geomorphic, erosional, and substrate variables and 26 biotic responses that have been associated with landuse disturbance in third- and fourth-order streams in the Blue Ridge physiographic province in western North Carolina (USA). Regression analyses reduced this set of variables to include only those that responded to land cover and/or affected biota. From this reduced variable set, hypotheses were generated that predicted the disturbance pathways affecting each biotic response following the land-cover-cascade design. Cascade pathways began with land cover and ended with biotic responses, passing through at least one intermediate ecosystem abiotic component. Cascade models were tested for predictive ability and goodness-of-fit using path analysis. Biota were influenced by near-stream urban, agricultural, and forest land cover as propagated by hydrologic (e.g., discharge), geomorphic (e.g., stream bank height), erosional (e.g., suspended sediments), and depositional streambed (e.g., substrate size) features occurring along LCC pathways, reflecting abiotic mechanisms mediating land-cover disturbance. Our results suggest that communities are influenced by land-cover change indirectly through a hierarchy of associated abiotic components that propagate disturbance to biota. More generally, the land-cover cascade concept and experimental framework demonstrate an organized approach to the generic study of cascades and the complex relationships between landscapes and streams.},

  abstract = {Loading of nutrients from terrestrial ecosystems strongly influences the productivity and biogeochemistry of aquatic ecosystems. Human activities can supplement and even dominate nutrient loading to many lakes, particularly in agricultural and urbanized settings. For lakes in more remote regions such as the Adirondack Mountains of New York, N deposition represents the primary potential anthropogenic nutrient source. We combined a spatial model of N deposition with data on lake-N concentrations and spatial data on watershed configuration to identify the sources of watershed N loading for over 250 lakes in the Adirondacks. The analysis indicates that while wetlands are stronger sources of N loading per unit area than forests in the absence of inorganic N deposition, wetlands retain essentially all N deposition, while forests retained ;87\% of N deposition. Since forests cover close to 90\% of the watersheds, upland forests are, on average, the single largest source of N loading to Adirondack lakes. Direct deposition of N to the lake surface accounted for as large a fraction of loading as that from wetlands in the watersheds. We found no evidence that presence of wetlands along flowpaths to lakes reduced loading from upland forests. Moreover, there was no evidence that net loading to lakes declined with increasing distance of a source area to the lake. Lake N-concentrations thus primarily reflect N-loading from forests in concert with loss rates determined by water residence time and within-lake processes.},

The horseshoe is a close cousin of other widely used Bayes rules arising from, for example, double-exponential and Cauchy priors, in that it is a member of the same family of multivariate scale mixtures of normals. But the horseshoe enjoys a number of advantages over existing approaches, including its robustness, its adaptivity to different sparsity patterns, and its analytical tractability. We prove two theorems that formally characterize both the horseshoe's adeptness at large outlying signals, and its super-efficient rate of convergence to the correct estimate of the sampling density in sparse situations. Finally, using a combination of real and simulated data, we show that the horseshoe estimator corresponds quite closely to the answers one would get by pursuing a full Bayesian model-averaging approach using a discrete mixture prior to model signals and noise.},

  abstract = {Diffuse nutrient loss from agriculture is degrading surface and groundwater quality throughout Europe, leaving water bodies at risk of not reaching targets set by the Water Framework Directive (WFD). Mitigation methods to reduce diffuse agricultural nutrient loss need to be implemented where water bodies have been identified as at risk of not reaching good status by 2015. Though the effectiveness of individual mitigation methods has usually been assessed in controlled experiments, it is necessary to quantify impact under a wider range of environmental and agricultural conditions and at the catchment scale to ensure that action taken now will be sufficient to meet WFD targets. Due to catchment buffering and long transit times (N 50 years), it is unlikely that responses to intervention will be observed by 2015 in many water bodies. In this review, we compare the attributes and usefulness of different approaches (direct measurement, nutrient budgeting, risk assessment and modelling) to assess the efficacy of actions to mitigate sources and transport of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from agricultural land to water. Modelling and `measured changes in farm activity' through budgeting avoid the time lags associated with direct measurement and enable rapid evaluations of different options before implementation. Budgeting approaches using on-farm data also provide a simpler, more communicable means of assessment but currently fail to consider the timing and transport aspects of mitigation and assume a direct causal relationship between potential and actual nutrient loss. Risk assessment and modelling applications are potentially more comprehensive and able to better reflect choice of mitigation at a range of scales, but assessments demand increased availability of data, and there is a large degree of uncertainty associated with their spatial and temporal dimensions which is difficult to validate adequately. The failings of individual approaches suggest that these assessment methods should be integrated to maximise their potential usefulness and positive attributes. This will enable nutrient inputs to be utilised most efficiently at broad scales and site specific actions to reduce nutrient transport and delivery can be targeted most costeffectively at smaller scales. Such an integrated approach will also more effectively engage and involve the farmer in what must be an iterative process.},

Coupled natural and human systems (CNHS) modeling is one tool that can be used to study the complex, reciprocal linkages between human actions and ecosystem processes. Well-developed CNHS models exist at a conceptual level, but the mapping of these system representations in practice is limited in capturing these feedbacks. This article presents a paired conceptual\textendash empirical methodology for functionally capturing feedbacks between human and natural systems in freshwater lake catchments, from human actions to the ecosystem and from the ecosystem back to human actions. We address extant challenges in CNHS modeling, which arise from differences in disciplinary approach, model structure, and spatiotemporal resolution, to connect a suite of models. In doing so, we create an integrated, multi-disciplinary tool that captures diverse processes that operate at multiple scales, including land-management decision-making, hydrologic-solute transport, aquatic nutrient cycling, and civic engagement. In this article, we build on this novel framework to advance cross-disciplinary dialogue to move CNHS lake-catchment modeling in a systematic direction and, ultimately, provide a foundation for smart decision-making and policy.},

While a known suite of drivers associated with nutrient sources, nutrient transport, and internal processing controls concentrations of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) in lakes, much less is known about whether the drivers of single nutrient concentrations can also explain spatial or temporal variation in lake N:P stoichiometry. Predicting stoichiometry might be more complex than predicting concentrations of individual elements because some drivers have similar relationships with N and P, leading to a weak relationship with their ratio. Further, the dominant controls on elemental concentrations likely vary across regions, resulting in context dependent relationships between drivers, lake nutrients and their ratios. Here, we examine whether known drivers of N and P concentrations can explain variation in N:P stoichiometry, and whether explaining variation in stoichiometry differs across regions. We examined drivers of N:P in \textasciitilde 2,700 lakes at a sub-continental scale and two large regions nested within the sub-continental study area that have contrasting ecological context, including differences in the dominant type of land cover (agriculture vs. forest). At the sub-continental scale, lake nutrient concentrations were correlated with nutrient loading and lake internal processing, but stoichiometry was only weakly correlated to drivers of lake nutrients. At the regional scale, drivers that explained variation in nutrients and stoichiometry differed between regions. In the Midwestern U.S. region, dominated by agricultural land use, lake depth and the percentage of row crop agriculture were strong predictors of stoichiometry because only phosphorus was related to lake depth and only nitrogen was related to the percentage of row crop agriculture. In contrast, all drivers were related to N and P in similar ways in the Northeastern U.S. region, leading to weak relationships between drivers and stoichiometry. Our results suggest ecological context mediates controls on lake nutrients and stoichiometry. Predicting stoichiometry was generally more difficult than predicting nutrient concentrations, but human activity may decouple N and P, leading to better prediction of N:P stoichiometry in regions with high anthropogenic activity.},

Past studies have been conducted mostly on individual or small groups of ecosystems, making it challenging to predict how future climate change will affect water quality at broad scales. We used a subcontinental-scale database to address three objectives: (1) identify which climate metrics best predict lake water quality, (2) examine whether climate influences different nutrient and productivity measures similarly, and (3) quantify the potential effects of a changing climate on lakes. We used climate data to predict lake water quality in \textasciitilde 11,000 north temperate lakes across 17 U.S. states. We developed a novel machine learning method that jointly models different measures of water quality using 48 climate metrics and accounts for properties inherent in macroscale data (e.g., spatial autocorrelation). Our results suggest that climate metrics related to winter precipitation and summer temperature were strong predictors of lake nutrients and productivity. However, we found variation in the magnitude and direction of the relationship between climate and water quality. We predict that a likely future climate change scenario of warmer summer temperatures will lead to increased nutrient concentrations and algal biomass across lakes (median \textasciitilde 3\%\textendash 9\% increase), whereas increased winter precipitation will have highly variable effects. Our results emphasize the importance of heterogeneity in the response of individual ecosystems to climate and are a caution to extrapolating relationships across space.},

Transport of labeled FPOM particles declined exponentially with downstream distance. yielding mean transport distances of 800 and 580 m in Smiley Creek in 1989 and 1990 at a mean water velocity of 0.27 m ss' and mean depth of 0.34 m in both years, and a distance of 630 m in the upper Salmon River at a mean velocity of 0.29 m s ' and a depth of 0.14 m. These travel distances are equivalent to vertical deposition velocities of 0.7-l .6 mm s I, or - 7- 12\% of the temperature-corrected quiescent-water fall velocities of the FPOM particles. The estimated deposition flux of - 1.5 g (AFDM) m 1 d ' would turn over the standing stock of 0.8 g m 1 in surficial sediments twice daily. Sampling of benthic FPOM 24 h after release indicated that -99\% of the 14C-labeled FPOM initially deposited in the 1,005-m study reach had been resuspended and exported; subsequent clearing was much slower. An advection-dispersion model satisfactorily simulated the deposition of 14C-labeled particles and their subsequent resuspension and export from the reach. Model-estimated retention times were 1.53 h for 99\% of deposited sediments and 17 d for the remaining 1\%. Thus, particles in surficial sediments exchange rapidly with the water column and migrate downstream several kilometers per day in alternating deposition and resuspension events. These results support the overall concept that conditions throughout a river system are strongly connected longitudinally and that OM introduced in headwater reaches can be transported large distances for later use or storage elsewhere in the river or for eventual export to estuaries.},

  abstract = {Freshwater resources are vital for human and natural systems. However, anthropogenic activities, such as agricultural practices, have led to the degradation of the quality of these limited resources through pollutant loading. Agricultural Best Management Practices (BMPs), such as wetlands, are recommended as a valuable solution for pollutant removal. However, evaluation of their long-term impacts is difficult and requires modeling since performing in-situ monitoring is expensive and not feasible at the watershed scale. In this study, the impact of natural wetland implementation on total phosphorus reduction was evaluated both at the subwatershed and watershed levels. The study area is the Saginaw River Watershed, which is largest watershed in Michigan. The phosphorus reduction performances of four different wetland sizes (2, 4, 6, and 8 ha) were evaluated within this study area by implementing one wetland at a time in areas identified to have the highest potential for wetland restoration. The subwatershed level phosphorus loads were obtained from a calibrated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. These loads were then incorporated into a wetland model (System for Urban Stormwater Treatment and Analysis IntegratioN-SUSTAIN) to evaluate phosphorus reduction at the subwatershed level and then the SWAT model was again used to route phosphorus transport to the watershed outlet. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate the spatial impact of wetland size and placement on phosphorus reduction. Overall, the performance of 2 ha wetlands in total phosphorus reduction was significantly lower than the larger sizes at both the subwatershed and watershed levels. Regarding wetland implementation sites, wetlands located in headwaters and downstream had significantly higher phosphorus reduction than the ones located in the middle of the watershed. More specifically, wetlands implemented at distances ranging from 200 to 250 km and 50e100 km from the outlet had the highest impact on phosphorus reduction at the subwatershed and watershed levels, respectively. A multi criteria decision making (MCDM) method named VIKOR was successfully executed to identify the most suitable wetland size and location for each subwatershed considering the phosphorus reduction and economic cost associated with wetland implementation. The methods introduced in this study can be easily applied to other watersheds for selection and placement of wetlands while considering environmental benefits and economic costs.},

Reliable targeting of critical source areas, such as erosion-prone fields and parts of fields, is necessary to improve the cost efficiency of mitigation measures. We used high-resolution (2 m 9 2 m) distributed modelling to calculate erosion risk for a large area (202 279 km2) covering [ 90\% of Swedish arable land. Comparison of model results with independent farmers' observations in a pilot catchment showed high spatial agreement. The modelled worst case scenario produced reasonable quantitative results comparable to measured 90th percentile values of suspended sediment (SS) loads at both field and small catchment scale (R2 = 0.81, p \textbackslash{} 0.001). Overall, loads of SS, especially during extreme episodes, strongly governed losses of unreactive P and total P at both field and catchment scale.},

This problem is that of allocating the data from a set of source spatial units to a set of target spatial units. In the literature, there are three main types of such techniques: proportional weighting schemes, smoothing techniques and regression based interpolation. We propose a stochastic model based on Poisson point processes to study the statistical accuracy of these techniques for regular grid targets in the case of count data. For simplicity, we restrict attention to count related target variables, proportional weighting schemes and Poisson regression based methods. The error depends on many factors including the relative size of the targets with respect to the sources, the homogeneity of the auxiliary information variables and the relative importance of the different auxiliary information in the mean target values. Our conclusion is that there is no technique which always dominates at finite distance but that asymptotically the pycnophylactic Poisson regression is the best feasible method among the ones considered.},

To assess these land change dynamics and their causes in the Great Plains, we compare and contrast contemporary changes across 16 ecoregions using Landsat satellite data and statistical analysis. Large-area change analysis of agricultural regions is often hampered by change detection error and the tendency for land conversions to occur at the local-scale. To facilitate a regional-scale analysis, a statistical sampling design of randomly selected 10 km \texttimes{} 10 km blocks is used to efficiently identify the types and rates of land conversions for four time intervals between 1973 and 2000, stratified by relatively homogenous ecoregions. Nearly 8\% of the overall Great Plains region underwent land-use and land-cover change during the study period, with a substantial amount of ecoregion variability that ranged from less than 2\% to greater than 13\%. Agricultural land cover declined by more than 2\% overall, with variability contingent on the differential characteristics of regional human\textendash environment systems. A large part of the Great Plains is in relatively stable land cover. However, other land systems with significant biophysical and climate limitations for agriculture have high rates of land change when pushed by economic, policy, technology, or climate forcing factors. The results indicate the regionally based potential for land cover to persist or fluctuate as land uses are adapted to spatially and temporally variable forcing factors.},

Not surprisingly, the range of management options suggested by such models' simulations are largely linked to changes in land use. This problem is addressed by developing models of dissolved phosphorus ͑DP͒ mobility for specific agricultural sources: manure, fertilizers, soil/plant complexes, and impervious surfaces and those associated with baseflow P loads. These models are coupled with a spatially distributed hydrologic model, the variable source loading function model. The model was applied to a small ͑164 ha͒, upstate New York watershed and tested against 1996\textendash 2000 stream flow and DP data. The source-specific model required no direct calibration of parameters compared to eight parameters needed in a similar export coefficient type model. Both models predicted stream DP loads well but the source-specific model provided additional insights into, for example, how much DP in the stream was derived from accumulated soil P as opposed to direct leaching from manure. This type of information is necessary to develop and assess a full range of options for best management practices, especially those that involve nonstatic activities such as manure spreading.},

This study estimated the bioavailability of particulate phosphorus, in forested, urban, agricultural (i.e. dairy farm) and mixed land cover streams. Sixteen stream sites were sampled during base and storm flow conditions and the following parameters were determined: total suspended solids, total phosphorus, total dissolved phosphorus, particulate phosphorus, percent bioavailable particulate phosphorus (\%BAPP), total bioavailable phosphorus and sediment particle size distribution. Algal assays with Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata were used to measure \%BAPP. Percent BAPP averaged 17\%, 26\% and 24\% for streams draining catchments with forested, mixed use and agricultural land cover, respectively, and \%BAPP did not vary significantly between base and storm flow conditions in these stream types. In contrast, \%BAPP averaged 73\% in the urban streams during baseflows but declined to an average of only 19\% during storms. Particle size distributions did not correlate with \%BAPP in these samples. During storm events, particulate phosphorus concentrations increased in all streams by an average of 614\% and total phosphorus increased by 200\%, whereas total BAP (i.e. total dissolved phosphorus+\%BAPP \^A particulate phosphorus) only increased by 72\% because on average only 20\% of the particulate phosphorus transported during these events was biologically available.},

It is unclear, however, how generalizable this effect might be. Here, we analyzed a large water quality dataset of 2385 lakes spanning 60 regions across 17 states in the Northeastern and Midwestern U.S. to determine if N subsidy-stress effects on phytoplankton are common and to identify regional landscape characteristics promoting N stress effects in lakes. We used a Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework to test our hypothesis that Chl a\textendash total N (TN) threshold relationships would be common across the central agricultural region of the U.S. (``the Corn Belt''), where lake N and P concentrations are high. Data aggregated across all regions indicated that high TN concentrations had a negative effect on Chl a in lakes with concurrent high total P. This large-scale pattern was driven by relationships within only a subset of regions, however. Eight regions were identified as having Chl a\textendash TN threshold relationships, but only two of these regions located within the Corn Belt clearly demonstrated this subsidy-stress relationship. N stress effects were not consistent across other intense agricultural regions, as we hypothesized. These findings suggest that interactions among regional land use and land cover, climate, and hydrogeology may be important in determining the synergistic conditions leading to N subsidy-stress effects on lake phytoplankton.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) commonly co-limit primary productivity in lakes, and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) is predicted to be greatest under high N, high P regimes. Because land use practices can alter N and P biogeochemical cycles in watersheds, it is unclear whether previously documented phytoplankton\textendash nutrient relationships apply where landscapes are highly disturbed. Here, we analyzed a lake water quality database from an agricultural region to explore relationships among Chl-a, total N (TN), and total P (TP) under extreme nutrient concentrations. Chl-a was weakly related to TN when TP was {$\leq$}100 {$\mu$}g L-1 but displayed a stronger response to TN at higher TP. When TP exceeded 100 {$\mu$}g L-1, Chl-a increased with increasing TN until reaching a TN threshold of \textasciitilde 3 mg L-1 and decreased thereafter, resulting in a high nutrient, low Chl-a region that did not coincide with shifts in nutrient limitation, light availability, cellular Chl-a content, phytoplankton composition, or zooplankton grazing pressure. Beyond the threshold, nitrate comprised most of TN and occurred with reduced dissolved organic matter (DOM). These observations suggest that photolysis of nitrate may produce reactive oxygen species that damage DOM and phytoplankton. Reduction in N loading at high P could therefore increase Chl-a and decrease water clarity, resulting in an apparent worsening of water quality. Our data suggest that monitoring Chl-a or Secchi depth may fail to indicate water quality degradation by extreme nutrient concentrations. These findings highlight how extreme nutrient regimes in lakes can produce novel relationships between phytoplankton and nutrients.},

Circulation of anthropogenic Nr in Earth's atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere has a wide variety of consequences, which are magnified with time as Nr moves along its biogeochemical pathway. The same atom of Nr can cause multiple effects in the atmosphere, in terrestrial ecosystems, in freshwater and marine systems, and on human health. We call this sequence of effects the nitrogen cascade. As the cascade progresses, the origin of Nr becomes unimportant. Reactive nitrogen does not cascade at the same rate through all environmental systems; some systems have the ability to accumulate Nr, which leads to lag times in the continuation of the cascade. These lags slow the cascade and result in Nr accumulation in certain reservoirs, which in turn can enhance the effects of Nr on that environment. The only way to eliminate Nr accumulation and stop the cascade is to convert Nr back to nonreactive N2.},

  abstract = {Crop rotation is a commonly used management practice in the central U.S. whereby different agricultural crops are grown on a farm field in successive years to help maintain the productive capacity of the soil. Understanding hydrologic responses to crop rotation is critical for developing appropriate crop rotation strategies for sustainable water resources management. These responses are not well understood due to limited availability of multi-year, crop-specific land use-land cover data. The study focuses on the Smoky Hill River watershed in westcentral Kansas, a typical agro-ecosystem watershed in the Central Great Plains of the U.S. A multi-year land use dataset developed for the state of Kansas was used to identify 3-year crop rotation patterns in the watershed for three different periods (2006\textendash 08, 2008\textendash 10, 2010\textendash 12). Out of 276 unique rotations, 21 rotations were found to be dominant, with rotation patterns of grain sorghum-fallow-winter wheat (G-F-W), winter wheat-winter wheatfallow (W-W-F), and continuous winter wheat (W-W-W) occupying more than 81\% of the cropland in each rotation period. From 2006 to 2012, the coverage of grain sorghum increased by 26\% and corn by 305\%, while winter wheat decreased by 20\%. Three 11-year simulation scenarios based on three 3-year crop rotation patterns were implemented in the SWAT model and separately calibrated for streamflow at two gauge sites. The SWAT model produced good calibration statistics for the periods corresponding to the applied crop rotations, while the statistics tended to decrease for other periods, with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient becoming unsatisfactory for periods of six to eight years outside of the calibration period. Applying a different number of dominant crop rotations to the SWAT model, it was found that the number can be reduced down to the five most dominant without significant loss in model performance. While the optimum number of crop rotations must be evaluated for each agricultural watershed, this finding provides valuable information for watershed model development and calibration, which can help to avoid issues of over-parameterization and equifinality.},

  abstract = {The percentage of a watershed occupied by agricultural areas is widely used to predict nutrient loadings and in-stream water chemistry because water quality is often linked to non-point sources in a watershed. Measures of the spatial location of source areas have generally not been incorporated into such landscape indicators although empirical evidence and watershed loading models suggest that spatially explicit information is useful for predicting loadings. I created a heuristic grid-based surface-flow model to address the discrepancies between spatially explicit and non-spatial approaches to understanding watershed loading. The mean and variance in loading were compared among thousands of simulated watersheds with varying percentages of randomly located source and sinks. The variability in loading among replicate landscapes was greatest for those landscapes with \$65\% source areas. This variance peak suggests that considering the spatial arrangement of cover types is most important for watersheds with intermediate relative abundances of sources and sinks as the wide variety of different spatial configurations can lead to either very high or very low loading. Increasing the output from source pixels (relative to the amount absorbed by sink pixels) among different landscapes moved the peak in variance to landscapes with lower percentages of sources. A final scenario examined both broad- and fine-scale heterogeneity in source output to disentangle the relative contributions of spatial configuration, percentage of source covers, and heterogeneity of sources in governing variability in loading. In landscapes with high percentages of source pixels, fine-scale heterogeneity in source output was responsible for a greater portion of the total variability in loading among different watersheds than was spatial arrangement. These results provide several testable hypotheses for when spatial and non-spatial approaches might be most useful in relating land cover to water chemistry and suggest improvements for the spatial sensitivity analyses of eco-hydrologic watershed models.},

Five agricultural best management practices (BMPs) were implemented in SWAT one at a time in each subbasin. Five statistical models were used to determine the pollution reduction at the watershed outlet using distance and BMP type, with results suggesting that a mixed effects model (model 5) was optimal. This model included subbasin as a random effect, while distance to watershed outlet and BMP type were fixed effects. Native grass and strip cropping were the most effective BMPs for reducing sediment and nutrient transport. Subbasins containing stream orders 1e3 were ideal for BMP implementation throughout the watershed.},

(The costs of applying manure at these rates have not been assessed). Even so, manure that is produced on operations that cannot fully apply it to their own land at agronomic rates accounts for 60 percent of the Nation's manure nitrogen and 70 percent of the manure phosphorus. In these cases, most counties with farms that produce ``excess'' nutrients have adequate crop acres not associated with animal operations, but within the county, on which it is feasible to spread the manure at agronomic rates. However, barriers to moving manure to other farms need to be studied. About 20 percent of the Nation's onfarm excess manure nitrogen is produced in counties that have insufficient cropland for its application at agronomic rates (23 percent for phosphorus). For areas without adequate land, alternatives to local land application\textemdash such as energy production\textemdash will need to be developed.},

  abstract = {Human activities have increased the flow of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) over much of the Earth, leading to increased agricultural production, but also the degradation of air, soil, and water quality. Here we quantify the sources of anthropogenic N and P inputs to 76 watersheds of the St. Lawrence Basin (SLB) throughout the 20th century using NANI/NAPI (net anthropogenic N/P input to watersheds), a mass balance modeling approach, and estimate the fraction of these inputs exported to adjacent rivers. Our results show that since 1901, NANI and NAPI increased 4.5-fold and 3.8-fold, respectively, with a peak in 1991 mainly due to high atmospheric N deposition and P fertilizer application. However, the relative increase over the course of the last century was much higher in certain watersheds, particularly those where there was greater urbanization. Ranges in NANI and NAPI vary greatly among watersheds (110 to 9351 kg N km\`A2 yr\`A1 and 0.16 to 1938 kg P km\`A2 yr\`A1, respectively in 2011) and are strongly related to riverine fluxes (R2 = 0.87 and 0.71 for N and P, respectively). Our results suggest that 22\% of NANI (ranging from 11\% to 68\% across watersheds) and 17\% of NAPI (ranging from 3\% to 173\%) are exported to rivers. Predominant sources of inputs vary spatially and through time largely due to changes in farming practices. By tracking the main sources of inputs to specific watersheds and through time, our work provides insights for N and P management. Reduction strategies will likely need to be watershed specific, although through time, our results clearly show the large-scale impact of targeted legislation.},

  abstract = {Phosphorus (P) loading to lakes is degrading the quality and usability of water globally. Accurate predictions of lake P dynamics are needed to understand whole-ecosystem P budgets, as well as the consequences of changing lake P concentrations for water quality. However, complex biophysical processes within lakes, along with limited observational data, challenge our capacity to reproduce short-term lake dynamics needed for water quality predictions, as well as long-term dynamics needed to understand broad scale controls over lake P. Here we use an emerging paradigm in modeling, process-guided machine learning (PGML), to produce a phosphorus budget for Lake Mendota (Wisconsin, USA) and to accurately predict epilimnetic phosphorus over a time range of days to decades. In our implementation of PGML, which we term a Process-Guided Recurrent Neural Network (PGRNN), we combine a process-based model for lake P with a recurrent neural network, and then constrain the predictions with ecological principles. We test independently the process-based model, the recurrent neural network, and the PGRNN to evaluate the overall approach. The process-based model accounted for most of the observed pattern in lake P; however it missed the long-term trend in lake P and had the worst performance in predicting winter and summer P in surface waters. The root mean square error (RMSE) for the process-based model, the recurrent neural network, and the PGRNN was 33.0 {$\mu$}g P L-1, 22.7 {$\mu$}g P L-1, and 20.7 {$\mu$}g P L-1, respectively. All models performed better during summer, with RMSE values for the three models (same order) equal to 14.3 {$\mu$}g P L-1, 10.9 {$\mu$}g P L-1, and 10.7 {$\mu$}g P L-1. Although the PGRNN had only marginally better RMSE during summer, it had lower bias and reproduced long-term decreases in lake P missed by the other two models. For all seasons and all years, the recurrent neural network had better predictions than process alone, with root mean square error (RMSE) of 23.8 {$\mu$}g P L-1 and 28.0 {$\mu$}g P L-1, respectively. The output of PGRNN indicated that new processes related to water temperature, thermal stratification, and long term changes in external loads are needed to improve the process model. By using ecological knowledge, as well as the information content of complex data, PGML shows promise as a technique for accurate prediction in messy, real-world ecological dynamics, while providing valuable information that can improve our understanding of process.},

  abstract = {Small topographic depressions have important functions in hydrology and ecology because they store water in the form of shallow lakes, wetlands or ephemeral ponds. The relations between the area A, the volume V, and the depth h of water in depressions are important for evaluating water and dissolved-mass balances of the system. The A\textendash h and V\textendash h relations are usually determined from fine-resolution elevation maps based on detailed survey data. Simple equations are presented in this paper, which can be used to: (1) interpolate A\textendash h and V\textendash h data points obtained by a detailed survey; (2) approximate unknown A\textendash h and V\textendash h relations of a depression from a minimal set of field data without a time-consuming elevation survey; and (3) serve as a geometric model of depressions in simulation studies. The equations are simple power functions having two constants. The first constant s is related to the size of the depression, and the second constant p is related to the geometry of the depression. The power functions adequately represent A\textendash h and V\textendash h relations of all 27 wetlands and ephemeral ponds examined in this paper, which are situated in the northern prairie region of North America. Assuming that the power functions are applicable for other similar topographic depressions, an observer only needs to measure A and h twice to determine the two constants in the equation. The equations will be useful in field studies requiring approximate A\textendash h and V\textendash h relations and in theoretical and modeling studies. ᭧ 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Precipitation quantity and intensity in turn drive the rates and ratios at which nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are exported from watersheds into lakes, but these rates and ratios are also modulated by watershed land use. This led us to ask the question, is the effect of precipitation on phytoplankton nutrient limitation dependent on watershed land use? Across 42 lakes, we found that phytoplankton in lakes in agricultural landscapes were usually P limited but shifted to strong N limitation under increased drought intensity, and that droughts promoted N-fixing cyanobacteria. In contrast, phytoplankton in lakes with forested watersheds were consistently N limited, regardless of drought status. This climate\textendash land use interaction suggests that droughts may increase the incidence of N limitation in agriculturally impacted lakes. N limitation would likely impair valuable ecosystem services such as drinking water, fisheries, and recreation by promoting the occurrence and severity of cyanobacterial blooms.},

The Phosphorus Export Risk Matrix (PERM) is presented as an example NERM. The PERM integrates hydrological understanding of runoff with a number of agronomic and policy factors into a clear problem-solving framework. This allows farmers and policy makers to visualise strategies for reducing phosphorus loss through proactive land management. The risk of pollution is assessed by a series of informed questions relating to farming intensity and practice. This information is combined with the concept of runoff management to point towards simple, practical remedial strategies which do not compromise farmers ability to obtain sound economic returns from their crop and livestock.},

Analysis of these data indicated a very significant correlation between nitrate exports and percentage of each watershed in crops and abandoned agricultural land. A number of soil and topographic variables also had significant correlations with stream nitrate levels. The causal relationships underlying these simple correlations are difi\textasciitilde cult to evaluate because of considerable multicollinearity between land use and watershed physiography. The separate analysis of stream discharge indicated that agricultural watersheds have lower mean annual discharges (! s- t km- 2) than those watersheds containing extensive areas of forest and abandoned agricultural land. Variations in annual discharge therefore tended to reduce the contrast in nitrate exports between agricultural and non-agricultural watersheds. The influence of watershed characteristics on nitrate levels exhibited considerable seasonal contrasts. During summer low flow conditions nitrate concentration and loss were not correlated with watershed land use, and instead were affected primarily by localised pollution sources and by biological processes within the streams.},

Our work is the first study in which a consistent NANI calculation method is applied across the U.S. watersheds and tested against available riverine N flux estimates. Among the tested methodologies, yield-based estimation of agricultural N fixation (instead of crop area-based) made the largest difference, especially in some Mississippi watersheds where the tile drainage was a significant factor reducing watershed N retention. Across the U.S. watersheds, NANI was particularly sensitive to farm N fertilizer application, cattle N consumption, N fixation by soybeans and alfalfa, and N yield by corn, soybeans, and pasture, although their relative importance varied among different regions.},

NANI accounts for the fluxes of atmospheric N deposition, fertilizer N application, agricultural N fixation, and net food and feed imports, each of which represents a potentially important source of nitrogen in watersheds. In watersheds of sufficient size for the accounting to make sense, NANI has been shown to have a strong relationship with riverine nitrogen export. Since its first introduction, it has been applied to various regions of the US and the world by numerous researchers. Comparison and synthesis of these studies have been somewhat problematic due to discrepancies in the data sources and assumptions applied in their calculations. To address this problem, it would be useful to have a set of tools for calculating NANI from a standardized dataset allowing the user to clearly see the assumptions behind the calculations and alter them to test their sensitivity. Here we present a prototype of such a toolbox, the NANI Calculator Toolbox. The toolbox comprises three sets of tools: (1) a GIS tool overlaying a watershed map with various data maps to calculate overlaying proportions, (2) a set of Excelbased tools extracting necessary data from various standardized datasets (Agricultural Census, Census, USGS fertilizer input estimates, and CMAQ N deposition estimates), and (3) an Excel-based tool calculating the NANI budget and other related components (e.g., animal excretion) from the extracted data. All the datasets are included in this package, allowing the user to calculate NANI anywhere in the US from the watershed map of interest. As a demonstration, we present county-scale NANI estimates for the entire continental US and also for all the US watersheds where NANI have been reported in the earlier literature. Possible improvements of the toolbox and extension to European datasets are discussed.},

Less attention has been paid to the effects of adjacent land-uses on wetland sediment and water quality and, perhaps more importantly, the spatial scales at which these effects occur. Here we address these issues by examining variation in water and sediment nutrient levels in 73 southeastern Ontario, Canada, wetlands. We modeled the relationship between water and sediment nutrient concentrations and various measures of adjacent land-use such as forest cover and road density, measured over increasing distances from the wetland edge. We found that water nitrogen and phosphorous levels were negatively correlated with forest cover at 2250 meters from the wetland edge, while sediment phosphorous levels were negatively correlated with wetland size and forest cover at 4000 meters and positively correlated with the proportion of land within 4000 meters that is itself wetland. These results suggest that the effects of adjacent land-use on wetland sediment and water quality can extend over comparatively large distances. As such, effective wetland conservation will not be achieved merely through the creation of narrow buffer zones between wetlands and more intensive land-uses. Rather, sustaining high wetland water quality will require maintaining a heterogeneous regional landscape containing relatively large areas of natural forest and wetlands.},

In this work, two mathematical approaches to describe the shape of a lake basin are introduced and tested against empirical data. The two methods require only three easily available input parameters: maximum depth, surface area and volume. The first method is based on a traditional morphometric parameter, the volume development (Vd), and the second method on the new hypsographic development parameter (Hd). Both methods give area and volume at any depth of a lake and can furthermore be used to estimate lake bottom slopes. Comparisons with empirical area\textendash depth and volume\textendash depth distribution curves from 105 lakes that cover a wide range of lake morphometric characteristics have revealed that the two methods give very satisfactory results. The Vd-model yields r2-values of 0.924 and 0.907 for area and volume description with lake depth, respectively. The corresponding r2-values for the Hd-model are 0.988 and 0.996, respectively. Using the Hd-model, an approach has also been developed to test when and by how much it is necessary to correct the empirical volume of a lake given the number of measured strata and basin shape.},

Of particular interest is an ability to identify those areas where surface and ground waters have the greatest potential for high levels of nutrient and sediment loadings. High levels of nutrient and sediment loadings can have adverse effects on both humans and aquatic ecosystems. We analyzed the ability of landscape metrics generated from readily available, spatial data to predict nutrient and sediment yield to streams in the Mid-Atlantic Region in the United States. We used landscape metric coverages generated from a previous assessment of the entire Mid-Atlantic Region, and a set of stream sample data from the U.S. Geological Survey. Landscape metrics consistently explained high amounts of variation in nitrogen yields to streams (65 to 86\% of the total variation). They also explained 73 and 79\% of the variability in dissolved phosphorus and suspended sediment. Although there were differences in the nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment models, the amount of agriculture, riparian forests, and atmospheric nitrate deposition (nitrogen only) consistently explained a high proportion of the variation in these models. Differences in the models also suggest potential differences in landscape-stream relationships between ecoregions or biophysical settings. The results of the study suggest that readily available, spatial data can be used to assess potential nutrient and sediment loadings to streams, but that it will be important to develop and test landscape models in different biophysical settings.},

  abstract = {More diverse crop rotations have been promoted for their potential to remediate the range of ecosystem services compromised by biologically simplified grain-based agroecosystems, including increasing soil organic carbon (SOC). We hypothesized that functional diversity offers a more predictive means of characterizing the impact of crop rotations on SOC concentrations than species diversity per se. Furthermore, we hypothesized that functional diversity can either increase or decrease SOC depending on its associated carbon (C) input to soil. We compiled a database of 27 cropping system sites and 169 cropping systems, recorded the species and functional diversity of crop rotations, SOC concentrations (g C kg/soil), nitrogen (N) fertilizer applications (kg N\'Aha\`A1\'Ayr\`A1), and estimated C input to soil (Mg C\'Aha\`A1\'Ayr\`A1). We categorized crop rotations into three broad categories: grain-only rotations, grain rotations with cover crops, and grain rotations with perennial crops. We divided the grain-only rotations into two sub-categories: cereal-only rotations and those that included both cereals and a legume grain. We compared changes in SOC and C input using mean effect sizes and 95\% bootstrapped confidence intervals. Cover cropped and perennial cropped rotations, relative to grain-only rotations, increased C input by 42\% and 23\% and SOC concentrations by 6.3\% and 12.5\%, respectively. Within grain-only rotations, cereal + legume grain rotations decreased total C input (\`A16\%), root C input (\`A12\%), and SOC (\`A5.3\%) relative to cereal-only rotations. We found no effect of species diversity on SOC within grain-only rotations. N fertilizer rates mediated the effect of functional diversity on SOC within grain-only crop rotations: at low N fertilizer rates ({$\leq$}75 kg N\'Aha\`A1\'Ayr\`A1), the decrease in SOC with cereal + legume grain rotations was less than at high N fertilizer rates. Our results show that increasing the functional diversity of crop rotations is more likely to increase SOC concentrations if it is accompanied by an increase in C input. Functionally diverse perennial and cover cropped rotations increased both C input and SOC concentrations, potentially by exploiting niches in time that would otherwise be unproductive, that is, increasing the ``perenniality'' of crop rotations.},

  abstract = {Watershed land cover is widely used as a predictor of stream-ecosystem condition. However, numerous spatial factors can confound the interpretation of correlative analyses between land cover and stream indicators, particularly at broad spatial scales. We used a stream-monitoring data set collected from the Coastal Plain of Maryland, USA to address analytical challenges presented by (1) collinearity of land-cover class percentages, (2) spatial autocorrelation of land cover and stream data, (3) intercorrelations among and spatial autocorrelation within abiotic intermediaries that link land cover to stream biota, and (4) spatial arrangement of land cover within watersheds. We focused on two commonly measured stream indicators, nitrate-nitrogen (NO3\textendash N) and macroinvertebrate assemblages, to evaluate how different spatial considerations may influence results. Partial correlation analysis of land-cover percentages revealed that simple correlations described relationships that could not be separated from the effects of other land-cover classes or relationships that changed substantially when the influences of other land-cover classes were taken into account. Partial Mantel tests showed that all land-cover percentages were spatially autocorrelated, and this spatial phenomenon accounted for much of the variation in macroinvertebrate assemblages that could naively be attributed to certain classes (e.g., percentage cropland). We extended our use of partial Mantel tests into a path-analytical framework and identified several independent pathways between percentage developed land and instream measurements after factoring out spatial autocorrelation and other confounding variables; however, under these conditions, percentage cropland was only linked to nitrateN. Further analyses revealed that spatial arrangement of land cover, as measured by areal buffers and distance weighting, influenced the amount of developed land, resulting in a threshold change in macroinvertebrate-assemblage composition. Moreover, distanceweighted percentage cropland improved predictions of stream nitrate-N concentrations in small watersheds, but not in medium or large ones. Collectively, this series of analyses clarified the magnitude and critical scales of effects of different land-cover classes on Coastal Plain stream ecosystems and may serve as an analytical framework for other studies. Our results suggest that greater emphasis should be placed on these important spatial considerations; otherwise, we risk obscuring the relationships between watershed land cover and the condition of stream ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Clear Lake is on Iowa's list of impaired water bodies because of high P concentration. This study assessed soil-test phosphorus (STP), management practices, and P loads from its agricultural watershed. Management practice histories and STP for eight basins were surveyed in 1999. Soil samples (15-cm depth) were analyzed for STP with agronomic [Bray P1 (BP), Olsen (OP), Mehlich 3 (M3P)] and environmental [iron oxide\textendash impregnated paper (FeP) and water extraction (WP)] tests. Total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in water discharge from five basins were measured during two years, and TP loads were measured for two basins. The agronomic P tests showed that 46 to 83\% (depending on the test) of the area tested above optimum for crops. Correlations among tests were high for OP, M3P, and FeP (r Ͼ 0.96) and lower for BP and WP (r ϭ 0.88\textendash 0.93). Moldboardand chisel-plow tillage predominated (82\% of the area). Applied P (mainly fertilizer) averaged 15 kg P haϪ1 yrϪ1, and 40\% of the hightesting area (M3P test) was being fertilized. The mean annual water TP concentration across five basins was 275 to 474 ␮g LϪ1. The twoyear mean TP loads for the two gauged basins were 1504 and 1510 g P haϪ1 yrϪ1. Water TP concentration increased linearly with increasing STP. Relationships were stronger for M3P and FeP (R2 ϭ 0.96\textendash 0.97 for annual means and 0.77\textendash 0.79 for storm-flow events) than for BP or WP (R2 ϭ 0.88\textendash 0.91 and 0.59\textendash 0.69, respectively). Improving P and soil conservation practices in high-testing areas could reduce P loads to the lake.},

  abstract = {We investigated how watershed land use (a gradient of agricultural vs. forested land) relates to phytoplankton primary production (PPr) and photosynthetic parameters in 12 reservoirs in Ohio and examined spatial variation in these parameters. Shallow sites near stream inflows had higher light attenuation, total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll, nonvolatile suspended solids (NVSS), light-saturated photosynthesis (PmB ), and volumetric PPr than deeper sites near dam outflows, but areal PPr and the initial slope of the photosynthesis\textendash irradiance curve (\textvisiblespace B) were not significantly different between sites. Mean mixed layer irradiance and the severity of light limitation did not differ between sites because shallower depths compensated for higher light attenuation at inflow sites. Watershed land use (percent agriculture) was only weakly (but significantly) related to mean annual PPr, TP, and chlorophyll, but there was a well-defined upper limit to the effect of land use on all three of these parameters. Multiple regression showed that inclusion of additional watershed factors (the ratio of watershed land area to reservoir volume and the ratio of cropland area to number of livestock) greatly increased the variance explained compared to land use alone. TP and chlorophyll were highly correlated with each other and with PPr. Comparison of our TP\textendash chlorophyll, TP\textendash PPr, and chlorophyll\textendash PPr regressions with those of other studies suggests that reservoirs have lower PPr per unit TP than natural lakes, probably because of lower light intensity and higher concentrations of nonalgal P in reservoirs.},

The United States Department of Agriculture's Cropland Data Layer (CDL), an annual satellite imagery-derived land cover map, has been increasingly used for this application since complete coverage of the conterminous United States became available in 2008. However, the CDL is designed and produced with the intent of mapping annual land cover rather than tracking changes over time, and as a result certain precautions are needed in multi-year change analyses to minimize error and misapplication. We highlight scenarios that require special considerations, suggest solutions to key challenges, and propose a set of recommended good practices and general guidelines for CDL-based land change estimation. We also characterize a problematic issue of crop area underestimation bias within the CDL that needs to be accounted for and corrected when calculating changes to crop and cropland areas. When used appropriately and in conjunction with related information, the CDL is a valuable and effective tool for detecting diverse trends in agriculture. By explicitly discussing the methods and techniques for post-classification measurement of land-cover and land-use change using the CDL, we aim to further stimulate the discourse and continued development of suitable methodologies. Recommendations generated here are intended specifically for the CDL but may be broadly applicable to additional remotely-sensed land cover datasets including the National Land Cover Database (NLCD), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based land cover products, and other regional, national, and global land cover classification maps.},

Here we investigated the spatial configuration of land uses within watersheds in South Korea and examined how spatial patterns of urban, agricultural, and forest land uses measured at both landscape and class levels, related to water quality in adjacent reservoirs from landscape ecological perspective. The results indicate that water quality of reservoirs is closely associated with both the proportions of land use and the configurations of urban, agricultural, and forest areas. Water quality is more likely to be degraded when there is high interspersion of various land use types and when a large number of different land use types exist within a watershed. For urban land uses, high patch and edge densities, and urban land use as the largest patch, were also associated with water quality degradation, as were higher degrees of patch density and edge density for agricultural land uses. Water quality is likely better if forest patches are unfragmented, have a high value for the largest patch proportion, have complex patch shape, and are aggregated.},

The area of fallow in northeastern Montana, for example, has decreased by one-third, while the area of pulse crops has increased more than five-fold. Our objectives were: (1) to characterize the principal cropping sequences in northeast Montana during the period of regional pulse crop adoption (2001\textendash 2012); and (2) to identify changes in the relative proportions of these sequences during the same period. We identified crops at the field-level by class (cereal, pulse, fallow, or cereal\textendash fallow strips) for 2001\textendash 2012 using multitemporal Landsat imagery in conjunction with the cropland data layer, cadastral data, ground reference data, and local producers' records. The annual crop classifications were combined into a 12-character string for each field that represented the sequence of crop classes for 2001\textendash 2012. We then searched these strings for specific 2- and 3-year crop sequences with a string-matching algorithm. The most abundant sequences involved continuous cereal, block-managed cereal\textendash fallow, and cereal\textendash pulse. We also observed a steady decrease in the abundance of cereal\textendash fallow sequences managed by strip-cropping that were coincident with increases in blockmanaged cereal\textendash fallow sequences and with increases in pulse production. We conclude that, over the study's time frame, regional producers grew more cereal crops and fallowed fields less frequently, but did not appear to strongly adhere to specific sequences. Furthermore, strip-cropping as a management practice has declined substantially.},

  abstract = {The challenges we face in transitioning to a global production of biomass as renewable feedstock sources in a way that is both economical feasible environmentally sustainable are ubiquitous. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to predict the possible long-term environmental implications, specifically water quality, due to large-scale bioenergy cropping system expansion based on four landuse scenarios and 15 bioenergy crop rotations for four watersheds, totaling 244 model simulations. The study area consists of four watersheds totaling 53,358 km2 located in Michigan. The results suggest that perennial grass species are the most suitable for large-scale implementation, whereas traditional intensive row crops should be implemented with caution on such a broad scale. Row crops also had the highest increases of high priority areas for sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Based on the data from this study, it is not recommended that marginal land be converted to any bioenergy rotation in areas with preexisting high nitrogen levels. Statistical analyses demonstrate that perennial grass species significantly reduce sediment on all lands except marginal lands. With the exception of row crops cultivated on marginal lands and all agricultural land, the majority of bioenergy crops significantly reduce total phosphorus loads.},

We compared flux estimates into and out of the N and P ``pipes'' and showed the net removal rates of N and P by inland waters were less than those for C. The C : N : P stoichiometry of inland water inputs vs. exports differed due to large respiratory C and N losses, and efficient P burial in inland waters. Residence time plays a critical role in the processing of these elements through the pipe, where higher water residence times from streams to lakes results in substantial increases in C : N, C : P, and N : P ratios.},

Riparian buffer width is thought to be positively related to nitrogen removal effectiveness by influencing nitrogen retention or removal. We surveyed the scientific literature containing data on riparian buffers and nitrogen concentration in streams and groundwater to identify trends between nitrogen removal effectiveness and buffer width, hydrological flow path, and vegetative cover. Nitrogen removal effectiveness varied widely. Wide buffers (.50 m) more consistently removed significant portions of nitrogen entering a riparian zone than narrow buffers (0\textendash 25 m). Buffers of various vegetation types were equally effective at removing nitrogen but buffers composed of herbaceous and forest/herbaceous vegetation were more effective when wider. Subsurface removal of nitrogen was efficient, but did not appear to be related to buffer width, while surface removal of nitrogen was partly related to buffer width. The mass of nitrate nitrogen removed per unit length of buffer did not differ by buffer width, flow path, or buffer vegetation type. Our meta-analysis suggests that buffer width is an important consideration in managing nitrogen in watersheds. However, the inconsistent effects of buffer width and vegetation on nitrogen removal suggest that soil type, subsurface hydrology (e.g., soil saturation, groundwater flow paths), and subsurface biogeochemistry (organic carbon supply, nitrate inputs) also are important factors governing nitrogen removal in buffers.},

Results Fewer than 3\% of lakes had high scores for either aquatic or semi-aquatic connectivity. Connectivity scores were generally higher in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, which is heavily forested with greater land protection. Although lake protection was overall low (16 and 32\% of lake watersheds in Michigan were C 10\% protected under strict and multi-use protection, respectively), highly connected lakes were generally more protected than less connected lakes.
Conclusions We propose using our aquatic and semi-aquatic connectivity framework to (1) identify and prioritize lakes for conservation that are likely to have high biodiversity and conservation value and (2) generate testable hypotheses for studying the integrated terrestrial-aquatic landscape under global change.},

  abstract = {Wildfires are becoming larger and more frequent across much of the United States due to anthropogenic climate change. No studies, however, have assessed fire prevalence in lake watersheds at broad spatial and temporal scales, and thus it is unknown whether wildfires threaten lakes and reservoirs (hereafter, lakes) of the United States. We show that fire activity has increased in lake watersheds across the continental United States from 1984 to 2015, particularly since 2005. Lakes have experienced the greatest fire activity in the western United States, Southern Great Plains, and Florida. Despite over 30 years of increasing fire exposure, fire effects on fresh waters have not been well studied; previous research has generally focused on streams, and most of the limited lake-fire research has been conducted in boreal landscapes. We therefore propose a conceptual model of how fire may influence the physical, chemical, and biological properties of lake ecosystems by synthesizing the best available science from terrestrial, aquatic, fire, and landscape ecology. This model also highlights emerging research priorities and provides a starting point to help land and lake managers anticipate potential effects of fire on ecosystem services provided by fresh waters and their watersheds.},

  abstract = {Preventing harmful algal blooms (HABs) is needed to protect lakes and downstream ecosystems. Traditionally, reducing phosphorus (P) inputs was the prescribed solution for lakes, based on the assumption that P universally limits HAB formation. Reduction of P inputs has decreased HABs in many lakes, but was not successful in others. Thus, the ``P-only'' paradigm is overgeneralized. Whole-lake experiments indicate that HABs are often stimulated more by combined P and nitrogen (N) enrichment rather than N or P alone, indicating that the dynamics of both nutrients are important for HAB control. The changing paradigm from P-only to consideration of dual nutrient control is supported by studies indicating that (1) biological N fixation cannot always meet lake ecosystem N needs, and (2) that anthropogenic N and P loading has increased dramatically in recent decades. Sediment P accumulation supports long-term internal loading, while N may escape via denitrification, leading to perpetual N deficits. Hence, controlling both N and P inputs will help control HABs in some lakes and also reduce N export to downstream N-sensitive ecosystems. Managers should consider whether balanced control of N and P will most effectively reduce HABs along the freshwater-marine continuum.},

  abstract = {Agricultural nonpoint source pollution is the main source of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in the intensely row-cropped Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB) stream system and is considered the primary cause of the northern Gulf of Mexico hypoxic zone according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. A point of crucial importance in this region is therefore how intensive corn (Zea mays L.)-based cropping systems for food and fuel production can be sustainable and coexist with a healthy water environment, not only under existing climate conditions but also under a changed climate in the future. To address this issue, a UMRB integrated modeling system has been built with a greatly refined 12-digit subbasin structure based on the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) water quality model, which is capable of estimating landscape and in-stream water and pollutant yields in response to a wide array of alternative cropping and/or management strategies and climatic conditions.The effects of the following four agricultural management scenarios on crop production and pollutant loads exported from the cropland of the UMRB to streams and rivers were evaluated: (1) expansion of continuous corn across the entire basin, (2) adoption of no-till on all corn and soybean (Glycine max L.) fields in the region, (3) substitution of the traditional continuous corn and corn\textendash soybean rotations with an extended five-year rotation consisting of corn, soybean, and three years of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), and (4) implementation of a winter cover crop within the baseline rotations. The effects of each management scenario were evaluated both for current climate and a projected midcentury (2046 to 2065) climate from a General Circulation Model (GCM).All four scenarios behaved similarly under the historical and future climate, generally resulting in reduced erosion and nutrient loadings to surface water bodies compared to the baseline agricultural management. Continuous corn was the only scenario which resulted in increased N pollution while no-till was the most environmentally effective and able to sustain production at almost the same levels. Rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crop within the fallow period was also effective in reducing erosion and both sediment-bound and soluble forms of nutrients.The results indicated that alternative management practices could reduce sediment, N, and P exports from UMRB cropland by up to 50\% without significantly affecting yields. Results for the climate change scenario showed that the effectiveness of the management scenarios was strongly linked to the reduced water availability predicted under the future climate, which assisted in mitigating pollutant transport, although with a small loss of production.},

  abstract = {The flow of chemical materials along spatial elements is a fundamental aspect of landscape ecology. The research renders indicators for water pollution, which are utile for functional water management and land use planning. Ecologists identify mechanisms of nutrients transfer and mitigate their environmental impacts using freshwater wetlands and riparian buffers. In order to estimate the N (nitrogen) and P (phosphorus) loss risk, current research combines indicators into index models. The objective of this work was to review the factors of transport from upland source areas to surface water as N and P indicators, and to report on the magnitudes of N and P fluxes in agricultural landscapes under temperate climate. We reviewed the ISI Web of Science for recent developments on N and P transport factors and nutrient index models, and we suggested how to improve these schemes. We presented conceptual diagrams of N and P transport. Catchment-scale index models use factors of contributing distance, connectivity, soil properties, and erosion as indicators. P losses are mainly dependent on overland flow conduits and barriers, whereas subsurface flows control N more. Riparian vegetation accumulates great N and P amounts, while it is usually just a temporary sink. Riparian soil is a smaller but a more permanent store, whereas it may turn to a nutrient sink, too, when saturated. Anaerobic soil microbes denitrify somewhat less N, while this process is irreversible, and therefore equally crucial. In spite of this, most nutrient index models do not consider wetlands and riparian buffers. Hence we suggest to include the removal capacity of the riparian buffer zone in both catchment N and P index models. In general, we propose a landscape framework, which considers upland source areas, transit, and hydric riparian landscape elements as a single system. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We argue that the previous default choices are dubious due to their tendency to favor solutions with more unshrunk coefficients than we typically expect a priori. This can lead to bad results if this parameter is not strongly identified by data. We derive the relationship between the global parameter and the effective number of nonzeros in the coefficient vector, and show an easy and intuitive way of setting up the prior for the global parameter based on our prior beliefs about the number of nonzero coefficients in the model. The results on real world data show that one can benefit greatly \textendash{} in terms of improved parameter estimates, prediction accuracy, and reduced computation time \textendash{} from transforming even a crude guess for the number of nonzero coefficients into the prior for the global parameter using our framework.},

Allochthonous sediments are also a potential food source for detritivores, as is sedimenting autochthonous phytodetritus, the production of which is stimulated by nutrient inputs. We examined effects of allochthonous nutrient and sediment subsidies on fish and plankton, with special emphasis on gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum). This widespread and abundant omnivorous fish has many impacts on reservoir ecosystems, including negative effects on water quality via nutrient cycling and on fisheries via competition with sportfish. Gizzard shad are most abundant in agriculturally impacted, eutrophic systems; thus, agricultural subsidies may affect reservoir food webs directly and by enhancing gizzard shad biomass. We simulated agricultural subsidies of nutrients and sediment detritus by manipulating dissolved nutrients and allochthonous detritus in a 2 3 2 factorial design in experimental ponds.},

  abstract = {Methods. A framework for estimating lifecycle inventory data for variable nutrient loading from corn-soybean agriculture was developed. The approach uses 21 years of county-average data for agricultural and annual rainfall for 33 counties that approximate three major watersheds in eastern Iowa. A linear equation describes the relationship between the fraction of the applied nutrients that leach into the surface water and the annual rainfall. Model parameters were calibrated by minimizing the error in the difference between actual and modeled cumulative discharge to the Mississippi River over the period 1988\textendash 1998. Data from 1978\textendash 1987 were used to validate the method. Two separate approaches were then used to allocate the nutrient flows between the corn and soybeans.
Results and Discussion. The total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) leaching models provide good representation of the variability in measured nutrient loads discharged from eastern Iowa watersheds to the Mississippi River. The calibrated model estimates are within 1.1\% of the actual 11-year cumulative TN load and 0.3\% of the TP load. In contrast, a standard method used in other lifecycle assessments for estimating nutrient leaching based on a constant fraction of the nutrients leached provides a reasonable average, but does not capture the annual variability. Estimates of the TN load that can be allocated to corn range from 60 and 99\% between two allocation methods considered. This difference stems from a poorly understood symbiosis of nitrogen flows within the corn-soybean rotation that is difficult to integrate into an LCA.
Conclusions. Lifecycle inventories can include improved estimates non-point source nutrient flows to surface waters by incorporating climatic variability. Nutrient discharges to surface water are estimated with emission factors as a linear function of},

As we may not have the full knowledge of these confounding factors, conventional statistical meta-analysis methods can be misleading. We discuss the use of two statistical causal analysis methods for quantifying the effects of water and soil conservation practices in reducing P loss from agricultural fields. With the propensity score method, a subset of data was used to form a treatment group and a control group with similar distributions of confounding factors. With the multilevel modeling method, data were stratified based on important confounding factors, and the conservation practice effect was evaluated for each stratum. Both methods resulted in similar estimates of the conservation practice effect (total P load reduction avg. \textasciitilde 70\%). In addition, both methods show evidence of conservation practices reducing the incremental increase in total P export per unit increase in fertilizer application. These results are presented as examples of the types of outcomes provided by statistical causal analyses, not to provide definitive estimates of P loss reduction. The enhanced meta-analysis methods presented within are applicable for improved assessment of agricultural practices and their effects and can be used for providing realistic parameter values for watershed-scale modeling.},

As data from multiple study units across a wide spatiotemporal scale are increasingly accessible for researchers, an assessment of this assumption is now feasible. In this study, we demonstrate that this assumption is usually unjustified, due largely to a statistical phenomenon known as the Simpson's paradox. Through comparisons of a commonly used empirical model of the effect of nutrients on algal growth developed using several data sets, we discuss the cognitive importance of distinguishing factors affecting lake eutrophication operating at different spatial and temporal scales. Our study proposes the use of the Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach to properly structure the data analysis when data from multiple lakes are employed.},

  abstract = {The sustainability of hydrologic ecosystem services (freshwater benefits to people generated by terrestrial ecosystems) is challenged by human modification of landscapes. However, the role of landscape heterogeneity in sustaining hydrologic services at scales relevant to landscape management decisions is poorly understood. In particular, the relative importance of landscape composition (type and proportion of land cover) and configuration (spatial arrangement of cover types) is unclear. We analyzed indicators of production of three hydrologic services (freshwater supply, surface and ground water quality) in 100 subwatersheds in an urbanizing agricultural landscape (Yahara Watershed, Wisconsin, USA) and asked: (1) How do landscape composition and configuration affect supply of hydrologic services (i.e., does spatial pattern matter)? (2) Are there opportunities for small changes in landscape pattern to produce large gains in hydrologic services? Landscape composition and configuration both affected supply of hydrologic services, but composition was consistently more important than configuration for all three services. Together landscape composition and configuration explained more variation in indicators of surface-water quality than in freshwater supply or groundwater quality (Nagelkerke/adjusted R2: 86\%, 64\%, and 39\%, respectively). Surface-water quality was negatively correlated with percent cropland and positively correlated with percent forest, grassland and wetland. In addition, surface-water quality was greater in subwatersheds with higher wetland patch density, disaggregated forest patches and lower contagion. Surface-water quality responded nonlinearly to percent cropland and wetland, with greater water quality where cropland covered below 60\% and/or wetland above 6\% of the subwatershed. Freshwater supply was negatively correlated with percent wetland and urban cover, and positively correlated with urban edge density. Groundwater quality was negatively correlated with percent cropland and grassland, and configuration variables were unimportant. Collectively, our study suggests that altering spatial arrangement of land cover will not be sufficient to enhance hydrologic services in an agricultural landscape. Rather, the relative abundance of land cover may need to change to improve hydrologic services. Targeting subwatersheds near the cropland or wetland thresholds may offer local opportunities to enhance surface-water quality with minimal land-cover change.},

But, water data are collected by hundreds of research groups and organizations, many of which use nonstandard or inconsistent data descriptions and dissemination, and disparities across different types of water observation systems represent a major challenge for freshwater research. To address this issue, the Water Quality Portal (WQP) was developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the National Water Quality Monitoring Council to be a single point of access for water quality data dating back more than a century. The WQP is the largest standardized water quality data set available at the time of this writing, with more than 290 million records from more than 2.7 million sites in groundwater, inland, and coastal waters. The number of data contributors, data consumers, and third-party application developers making use of the WQP is growing rapidly. Here we introduce the WQP, including an overview of data, the standardized data model, and data access and services; and we describe challenges and opportunities associated with using WQP data.

  abstract = {Stream water quality can be greatly influenced by changes in agricultural practices, but studies of long-term dynamics are scarce. Here we describe trends over 21 yr (1994\textendash 2014) in nutrients and suspended sediments in three streams in a Midwestern US agricultural watershed. During this time, the watershed experienced substantial changes in agricultural practices, most importantly a pronounced shift from conventional to conservation tillage. In the 1990s and early 2000s, NH4, soluble reactive P, and suspended sediment concentrations (standardized for discharge and season) each declined significantly ({$>$}4\textendash 12\% per year) in at least two of the three streams (P {$<$} 0.01), whereas NO3 changed relatively little. However, since the early 2000s, declines in NH4 and sediment concentrations have slowed, soluble reactive P concentrations have not declined and may actually have increased, and NO3 concentrations have declined sharply. The more recent lack of decline in soluble reactive P coincides with a plateau in the prevalence of conservation tillage and may be because of increased soil P stratification due to long-term reduced tillage. The more recent decline in NO3 may be due to improved efficiency of N fertilizer use, increased soil denitrification, and/or declines in atmospheric N deposition. Our study shows that stream concentrations of N, P, and sediment can respond in contrasting ways to changes in agriculture, and that temporal trends can moderate, accelerate, or reverse over decadal timescales. Management strategies must consider contrasting temporal responses of water quality indicators and may need to be adaptively adjusted at scales of years to decades.},

  abstract = {Understanding the effects of land use on riparian systems is dependent upon the development of methodologies to recognize changes in sedimentation related to shifts in land use. Land use trends in southern New England consist of shifts from forested precolonial conditions, to colonial and agrarian land uses, and toward modern industrial\textendash urban landscapes. The goals of this study were to develop a set of stratigraphic indices that reflect these land use periods and to illustrate their applications. Twenty-four riparian sites from first- and second-order watersheds were chosen for study. Soil morphological features, such as buried surface horizons (layers), were useful to identify periods of watershed instability. The presence of human artifacts and increases in heavy metal concentration above background levels, were also effective indicators of industrial\textendash urban land use periods. Increases and peak abundance of non-arboreal weed pollen (Ambrosia) were identified as stratigraphic markers indicative of agricultural land uses. Twelve 14C dates from riparian soils indicated that the rise in non-arboreal pollen corresponds to the start of regional deforestation (AD 1749 6 56 cal yr; mean 6 2 SD) and peak non-arboreal pollen concentration corresponds to maximum agricultural land use (AD 1820 6 51 cal yr). These indices were applied to elucidate the impact of land use on riparian sedimentation and soil carbon (C) dynamics. This analysis indicated that the majority of sediment and soil organic carbon (SOC) stored in regional riparian soils is of postcolonial origins. Mean net sedimentation rates increased ;100-fold during postcolonial time periods, and net SOC sequestration rates showed an approximate 200-fold increase since precolonial times. These results suggest that headwater riparian zones have acted as an effective sink for alluvial sediment and SOC associated with postcolonial land use.},

  abstract = {Agricultural land use has often been linked to nutrient enrichment, habitat degradation, hydrologic alteration, and loss of biotic integrity in streams. The U.S. Geological Survey's National Water Quality Assessment Program sampled 226 stream sites located in eight agriculture-dominated study units across the United States to investigate the geographic variability and causes of agricultural impacts on stream biotic integrity. In this analysis we used structural equation modeling (SEM) to develop a national and set of regional causal models linking agricultural land use to measured instream conditions. We then examined the direct, indirect, and total effects of agriculture on biotic integrity as it acted through multiple water quality and habitat pathways. In our nation-wide model, cropland affected benthic communities by both altering structural habitats and by imposing water quality-related stresses. Regionspecific modeling demonstrated that geographic context altered the relative importance of causal pathways through which agricultural activities affected stream biotic integrity. Cropland had strong negative total effects on the invertebrate community in the national, Midwest, and Western models, but a very weak effect in the Eastern Coastal Plain model. In the Western Arid and Eastern Coastal Plain study regions, cropland impacts were transmitted primarily through dissolved water quality contaminants, but in the Midwestern region, they were transmitted primarily through particulate components of water quality. Habitat effects were important in the Western Arid model, but negligible in the Midwest and Eastern Coastal Plain models. The relative effects of riparian forested wetlands also varied regionally, having positive effects on biotic integrity in the Eastern Coastal Plain and Western Arid region models, but no statistically significant effect in the Midwest. These differences in response to cropland and riparian cover suggest that best management practices and planning for the mitigation of agricultural land use impacts on stream ecosystems should be regionally focused.},

The fractionation of these loads into dissolved and particulate, and inorganic and organic components allowed a detailed examination of the nutrient load composition and of the factors in\textasciimacron uencing both the relative and absolute magnitude of these components. The particulate phosphorus (TPP) loads account for 26{$\pm$}75\% of the annual total phosphorus (TP) transport and are predominantly inorganic. The inorganic (PIP) and organic (POP) fractions of the TPP loads represent 20{$\pm$}47\% and 6{$\pm$}28\% of the annual TP transport, respectively. In contrast, the particulate nitrogen loads (TPN) represent 8\% or less of the annual total nitrogen (TN) loads and are predominately organic. For dissolved P transport, the dissolved inorganic fraction (DIP) is more important, representing 15{$\pm$}70\% of the TP loads, whereas the dissolved organic fraction (DOP) represents only 3{$\pm$}9\% of the TP loads. The TN loads are dominated by the dissolved component and more particularly the total oxidized fraction (TON), which is composed of nitrate and nitrite and represents 76{$\pm$}82\% of the annual TN transport. The remaining dissolved N species, ammonium (NH4-N) and organic N (DON) account for 0.3{$\pm$}1.2\% and 13{$\pm$}16\% of the annual TN transport, respectively. The TPN and TPP \textasciimacron uxes closely re\textasciimacron ect the suspended sediment dynamics of the study basins, which are in turn controlled by basin size and morphology. The dissolved inorganic nutrient \textasciimacron uxes are in\textasciimacron uenced by point source inputs to the study basins, especially for P, although the TON \textasciimacron ux is primarily in\textasciimacron uenced by diuse source contributions and the hydrological connectivity between the river and its catchment area. The dissolved organic fractions are closely related to the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) dynamics, which are in turn in\textasciimacron uenced by land use and basin size. The magnitude of the NH4-N fraction was dependent on the proximity of the monitoring station to point source discharges, because of rapid nitri\textregistered cation within the water column. However, during storm events, desorption from suspended sediment may be temporarily important. Both the magnitude and relative contribution of the dierent nutrient fractions exhibit signi\textregistered cant seasonal variability in response to the hydrological regime, sediment mobilization, the degree of dilution of point source inputs and biological processes. \# 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Experiments in research on memory, language, and in other areas of cognitive science are increasingly being analyzed using Bayesian methods. This has been facilitated by the development of probabilistic programming languages such as Stan, and easily accessible front-end packages such as brms. The utility of Bayesian methods, however, ultimately depends on the relevance of the Bayesian model, in particular whether or not it accurately captures the structure of the data and the data analyst's domain expertise. Even with powerful software, the analyst is responsible for verifying the utility of their model. To demonstrate this point, we introduce a principled Bayesian workflow (Betancourt, 2018) to cognitive science. Using a concrete working example, we describe basic questions one should ask about the model: prior predictive checks, computational faithfulness, model sensitivity, and posterior predictive checks. The running example for demonstrating the workflow is data on reading times with a linguistic manipulation of object versus subject relative clause sentences. This principled Bayesian workflow also demonstrates how to use domain knowledge to inform prior distributions. It provides guidelines and checks for valid data analysis, avoiding overfitting complex models to noise, and capturing relevant data structure in a probabilistic model. Given the increasing use of Bayesian methods, we aim to discuss how these methods can be properly employed to obtain robust answers to scientific questions.

In an attempt to understand the factors that regulate DOC in lakes, we assembled a large database (7,514 lakes from 6 continents) of DOC concentrations and other parameters that characterize the conditions in the lakes, the catchment, the soil, and the climate. DOC concentrations were in the range 0.1\textendash 332 mg L21, and the median was 5.71 mg L21. A partial least squares regression explained 48\% of the variability in lake DOC and showed that altitude, mean annual runoff, and precipitation were negatively correlated with lake DOC, while conductivity, soil carbon density, and soil C : N ratio were positively related with lake DOC. A multiple linear regression using altitude, mean annual runoff, and soil carbon density as predictors explained 40\% of the variability in lake DOC. While lake area and drainage ratio (catchment : lake area) were not correlated to lake DOC in the global data set, these two factors explained significant variation of the residuals of the multiple linear regression model in several regional subsets of data. These results suggest a hierarchical regulation of DOC in lakes, where climatic and topographic characteristics set the possible range of DOC concentrations of a certain region, and catchment and lake properties then regulate the DOC concentration in each individual lake.},

Regression parameters of regional submodels of lake volume were similar across geographically and topographically different regions, indicating that the model probably is applicable for glacially formed lakes in general.

  abstract = {Although spatial and temporal variation in ecological properties has been well-studied, crucial knowledge gaps remain for studies conducted at macroscales and for ecosystem properties related to material and energy. We test four propositions of spatial and temporal variation in ecosystem properties within a macroscale (1000 km's) extent. We fit Bayesian hierarchical models to thousands of observations from over two decades to quantify four components of variation \textendash{} spatial (local and regional) and temporal (local and coherent); and to model their drivers. We found strong support for three propositions: (1) spatial variation at local and regional scales are large and roughly equal, (2) annual temporal variation is mostly local rather than coherent, and, (3) spatial variation exceeds temporal variation. Our findings imply that predicting ecosystem responses to environmental changes at macroscales requires consideration of the dominant spatial signals at both local and regional scales that may overwhelm temporal signals.},

  abstract = {Historical ecological surveys serve as a baseline and provide context for contemporary research, yet many of these records are not preserved in a way that ensures their long-term usability. The National Eutrophication Survey (NES) database is currently only available as scans of the original reports (PDF files) with no embedded character information. This limits its searchability, machine readability, and the ability of current and future scientists to systematically evaluate its contents. The NES data were collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency between 1972 and 1975 as part of an effort to investigate eutrophication in freshwater lakes and reservoirs. Although several studies have manually transcribed small portions of the database in support of specific studies, there have been no systematic attempts to transcribe and preserve the database in its entirety. Here we use a combination of automated optical character recognition and manual quality assurance procedures to make these data available for analysis. The performance of the optical character recognition protocol was found to be linked to variation in the quality (clarity) of the original documents. For each of the four archival scanned reports, our quality assurance protocol found an error rate between 5.9 and 17 \%. The goal of our approach was to strike a balance between efficiency and data quality by combining entry of data by hand with digital transcription technologies. The finished database contains information on the physical characteristics, hydrology, and water quality of about 800 lakes in the contiguous US (Stachelek et al., 2017, https://doi.org/10.5063/F1639MVD). Ultimately, this database could be combined with more recent studies to generate meta-analyses of water quality trends and spatial variation across the continental US.},

  abstract = {Hybrid watershed models based on nonlinear regression are useful tools for estimating the magnitude of loading rates (i.e., export coefficients) for various pollutant sources within large-scale river basins. Few such models, however, have incorporated temporal variability in either source distributions or climate, despite evidence that precipitation is the primary driver in interannual variability in loading rates. The model developed here includes changes in precipitation, land use, point source discharge, and livestock operations to capture temporal variability in nitrogen loads. Precipitation is incorporated directly in the formulation of export rates using coefficients that vary by source type. Instream and reservoir retention of nitrogen is included to account for nitrogen sinks within the watershed. A Bayesian hierarchical approach is employed to integrate uncertainty in loading estimates, include prior knowledge of parameters, address intrawatershed correlation, and estimate export coefficients probabilistically. We apply this method to three North Carolina river basins that have experienced substantial growth in urban development and livestock operations in the past few decades, and where eutrophication-related water quality problems are common. Accounting for temporal variability constrains uncertainties in nonpoint source export coefficients by nearly 50\%, relative to a spatial-only model. Results indicate that livestock operations are a significant contributor of nitrogen throughout much of the study area. Precipitation is shown to have a larger influence on export rates for agricultural than for developed lands, creating a system dominated by agricultural total nitrogen during high precipitation years and by developed (urban) regions during low precipitation years. Plain Language Summary Human activities increase the amount of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) entering streams, lakes, and coastal waters. At high levels, these nutrients can cause harmful algal blooms, fish kills, and other water quality problems. Therefore, it is important to understand where nutrients come from, so that they can be properly managed. In this study, we develop a model to better understand and quantify how different source types (cities, cropland, hogs and chicken livestock operations, and wildland) contribute to overall nitrogen loading. Using the model, our understanding of the importance of each source type is updated based on the amount of nitrogen observed in various streams across our study area. Streams with relatively high nitrogen levels indicate that the nitrogen source types in the stream's upstream watershed are relatively large contributors of nitrogen. When we leverage such data over a large area (eastern North Carolina) and over multiple decades, within the model, we can quantify loading rates from different source types with increased confidence. We can also predict how much of this nitrogen reaches sensitive downstream estuaries. In our study, we find that agricultural sources have become increasingly dominant over time, especially during relatively wet years.},

This study quantified the effects of tillage and nutrient source on tile line and surface inlet water quality under continuous corn (Zea mays L.) from relatively flat lands (Ͻ3\%). Tillage treatments were either fall chisel or moldboard plow. Nutrient sources were either fall injected liquid hog manure or spring incorporated urea. The experiment was on a Webster\textendash Canisteo clay loam (Typic Endoaquolls) at Lamberton, MN. Surface inlet runoff was analyzed for flow, total solids, NO3\textendash N, NH4\textendash N, dissolved P, and total P. Tile line effluent was analyzed for flow, NO3\textendash N, and NH4\textendash N. In four years of rainstorm and snowmelt events there were few significant differences ( p Ͻ 0.10) in water quality of surface inlet or tile drainage between treatments. Residue cover minimally reduced soil erosion during both snowmelt and rainfall runoff events. There was a slight reduction in mineral N losses via surface inlets from manure treatments. There was also a slight decrease ( p ϭ 0.025) in corn grain yield from chisel-plow plots (9.7 Mg haϪ1) compared with moldboardplow plots (10.1 Mg haϪ1). Chisel plowing (approximately 30\% residue cover) alone is not sufficient to reduce nonpoint source sediment pollution from these poorly drained flat lands to the extent (40\% reduction) desired by regulatory agencies.},

  abstract = {Nitrate N fluxes from tile-drained watersheds have been implicated in water quality studies of the Mississippi River basin, but actual NO3\textendash N loads from small watersheds during long periods are poorly documented. We evaluated discharge and NO3\textendash N fluxes passing the outlet of an Iowa watershed (5134 ha) and two of its tile-drained subbasins (493 and 863 ha) from mid-1992 through 2000. The cumulative NO3\textendash N load from the catchment was 168 kg haϪ1, and 176 and 229 kg haϪ1 from the subbasins. The outlet had greater total discharge (1831 mm) and smaller flow-weighted mean NO3\textendash N concentration (9.2 mg LϪ1) than the subbasins, while the larger subbasin had greater discharge (1712 vs. 1559 mm) and mean NO3\textendash N concentration (13.4 vs. 11.3 mg LϪ1) than the smaller subbasin. Concentrations exceeding 10 mg LϪ1 were common, but least frequent at the outlet. Nitrate N was generally not diluted by large flows, except during 1993 flooding. The outlet showed smaller NO3\textendash N concentrations at low flows. Relationships between discharge and NO3\textendash N flux showed log\textendash log slopes near 1.0 for the subbasins, and 1.2 for the outlet, considering autocorrelation and measurement-error effects. We estimated denitrification of subbasin NO3\textendash N fluxes in a hypothetical wetland using published data. Assuming that temperature and NO3\textendash N supply could limit denitrification, then about 20\% of the NO3\textendash N would have been denitrified by a wetland constructed to meet USDA-approved criteria. The low efficiency results from the seasonal timing and NO3\textendash N content of large flows. Therefore, agricultural and wetland best management practices (BMPs) are needed to achieve water quality goals in tiledrained watersheds.},

The use of this tool has also been advocated in the context of incentive-based agri-environmental schemes, but there has been little work to date to estimate the level of efficiency gains which it may help to achieve. This paper investigates the requirements to arrive at such estimates, using a Scottish farm woodland scheme as a case study. This agri-environmental scheme aims to provide visual amenity and biodiversity. Maps of these two benefits are used to develop improved spatial targeting scenarios that deliver significant efficiency gains in comparison to the existing scheme design. The paper discusses the nature of the spatial distribution of the relevant benefits at the landscape scale and the data requirements for the realistic estimation of efficiency gains. It concludes that although much work needs to be done, the methods available today could and should play a much greater role in improving the landscape-scale design of existing land use schemes focused on the delivery of non-market benefits.},

Gizzard shad link terrestrial landscapes and pelagic reservoir food webs by consuming detritus, translocating nutrients from sediment detritus to the water column, and consuming zooplankton. The abundance of gizzard shad increases with watershed agriculturalization, most likely through a variety of mechanisms operating on larval and adult life stages. Gizzard shad have myriad effects on reservoirs, including impacts on nutrients, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish, and many of their effects vary with ecosystem productivity (i.e., watershed land use). Interactive feedbacks among watersheds, gizzard shad populations, and reservoir food webs operate to maintain dominance of gizzard shad in highly productive systems. Thus, effective stewardship of reservoir ecosystems must incorporate both watershed and food-web perspectives.},

  abstract = {Ecosystems sometimes undergo dramatic shifts between contrasting regimes. Shallow lakes, for instance, can transition between two alternative stable states: a clear state dominated by submerged aquatic vegetation and a turbid state dominated by phytoplankton. Theoretical models suggest that critical nutrient thresholds differentiate three lake types: highly resilient clear lakes, lakes that may switch between clear and turbid states following perturbations, and highly resilient turbid lakes. For effective and efficient management of shallow lakes and other systems, managers need tools to identify critical thresholds and state-dependent relationships between driving variables and key system features. Using shallow lakes as a model system for which alternative stable states have been demonstrated, we developed an integrated framework using Bayesian latent variable regression (BLR) to classify lake states, identify critical total phosphorus (TP) thresholds, and estimate steady state relationships between TP and chlorophyll a (chl a) using cross-sectional data. We evaluated the method using data simulated from a stochastic differential equation model and compared its performance to k-means clustering with regression (KMR). We also applied the framework to data comprising 130 shallow lakes. For simulated data sets, BLR had high state classification rates (median/mean accuracy {$>$}97\%) and accurately estimated TP thresholds and state-dependent TP-chl a relationships. Classification and estimation improved with increasing sample size and decreasing noise levels. Compared to KMR, BLR had higher classification rates and better approximated the TP-chl a steady state relationships and TP thresholds. We fit the BLR model to three different years of empirical shallow lake data, and managers can use the estimated bifurcation diagrams to prioritize lakes for management according to their proximity to thresholds and chance of successful rehabilitation. Our model improves upon previous methods for shallow lakes because it allows classification and regression to occur simultaneously and inform one another, directly estimates TP thresholds and the uncertainty associated with thresholds and state classifications, and enables meaningful constraints to be built into models. The BLR framework is broadly applicable to other ecosystems known to exhibit alternative stable states in which regression can be used to establish relationships between driving variables and state variables.},

  abstract = {The Integrated Catchment Model of Nitrogen (INCA-N) was applied to the River Lambourn, a Chalk river-system in southern England. The model's abilities to simulate the long-term trend and seasonal patterns in observed stream water nitrate concentrations from 1920 to 2003 were tested. This is the first time a semi-distributed, daily time-step model has been applied to simulate such a long time period and then used to calculate detailed catchment nutrient budgets which span the conversion of pasture to arable during the late 1930s and 1940s. Thus, this work goes beyond source apportionment and looks to demonstrate how such simulations can be used to assess the state of the catchment and develop an understanding of system behaviour. The mass-balance results from 1921, 1922, 1991, 2001 and 2002 are presented and those for 1991 are compared to other modelled and literature values of loads associated with nitrogen soil processes and export. The variations highlighted the problem of comparing modelled fluxes with point measurements but proved useful for identifying the most poorly understood inputs and processes thereby providing an assessment of input data and model structural uncertainty. The modelled terrestrial and instream mass-balances also highlight the importance of the hydrological conditions in pollutant transport. Between 1922 and 2002, increased inputs of nitrogen from fertiliser, livestock and deposition have altered the nitrogen balance with a shift from possible reduction in soil fertility but little environmental impact in 1922, to a situation of nitrogen accumulation in the soil, groundwater and instream biota in 2002. In 1922 and 2002 it was estimated that approximately 2 and 18 kg N ha- 1 yr- 1 respectively were exported from the land to the stream. The utility of the approach and further considerations for the best use of models are discussed.},

Landscape-based regressions are also used to understand macroscale variability of lake nutrients, clarity, and productivity (hereafter referred to as nutrient-productivity). Predictions from both models are used to inform eutrophication management globally. To date, these two classes of models are generally conducted separately, which ignores the known dependencies among nutrient-productivity variables. We present a statistical model that integrates nutrient-productivity and landscape-based regressions\textemdash where lake nutrients, productivity, and clarity variables are modeled jointly. We fitted a joint nutrient-productivity model to over 7000 lakes with three nutrients (total phosphorus, total nitrogen, nitrate concentrations), chlorophyll a concentrations, and Secchi disk depth as response variables and landscape features as predictor variables. Because lakes in different regions respond to landscape features differently, we focused our analysis on two subregions with different dominant land uses, the agricultural Midwest and the forested Northeast U.S. Predictive performance was enhanced by modeling nutrientproductivity variables jointly. We also found strong evidence that nutrient-productivity variables were coupled, and that only nitrate may be decoupled from other nutrient-productivity variables in the forested region. We speculate that these regional differences may be related to differences in the strength of biogeochemical cycles and stoichiometric controls between these regions. Jointly modeling nutrient-productivity variables in lakes effectively integrates the two dominant approaches for studying lakes nutrient-productivity relationships and provides novel insight into macroscale patterns of the coupling of nutrients, chlorophyll, and water clarity in lakes.},

For each of 1,964 subbasins, we quantified the 1990 prevalence of cropland and riparian buffers. Cropland was considered buffered if the topographic flow path connecting it to a stream traversed a streamside forest or wetland. We applied a model that predicts stream nitrate concentration based on physiographic province and the watershed proportions of unbuffered and buffered cropland. We used another model to predict annual streamflow based on precipitation and temperature, and then multiplied the predicted flows and concentrations to estimate 1990 annual nitrate loads. Across the entire Chesapeake watershed, croplands released 92.3 Gg of nitrate nitrogen, but 19.8 Gg of that was removed by riparian buffers. At most, 29.4 Gg more might have been removed if buffer gaps were restored so that all cropland was buffered. The other 43.1 Gg of cropland load cannot be addressed with riparian buffers. The Coastal Plain physiographic province provided 52\% of the existing buffer reduction of Bay-wide nitrate loads and 36\% of potential additional removal from buffer restoration in cropland buffer gaps. Existing and restorable nitrate removal in buffers were lower in the other three major provinces because of less cropland, lower buffer prevalence, and lower average buffer nitrate removal efficiency.},

We combined geographic methods that account for buffer prevalence along flow paths connecting croplands to streams with improved statistical models to test for buffer effects on stream nitrate concentrations from 321 tributary watersheds to the Chesapeake Bay, USA. We developed statistical models that predict stream nitrate concentration from watershed land cover and physiographic province. We used information theoretic methods (AICc) to compare models with and without buffer terms, and we demonstrate that models accounting for riparian buffers better explain stream nitrate concentrations than models using only land cover proportions. We analyzed the buffer model parameters to quantify differences within and among physiographic provinces in the potentials for nitrate loss from croplands and nitrate removal in buffers. On average, buffers in Coastal Plain study watersheds had a higher relative nitrate removal potential (95\% of the inputs from cropland) than Piedmont buffers (35\% of inputs). Buffers in Appalachian Mountain study watersheds were intermediate (retaining 39\% of cropland inputs), but that percentage was uncertain. The absolute potential to reduce nitrate concentration was highest in the Piedmont study watersheds because of higher nitrate inputs from cropland. Model predictions for the study watersheds provided estimates of nitrate removals achieved with the existing cropland and buffer distributions. Compared to expected nitrate concentrations if buffers were removed, current buffers reduced average nitrate concentrations by 0.73 mg N/L (50\% of their inputs from cropland) in the Coastal Plain study watersheds, 0.40 mg N/L (11\%) in the Piedmont, and 0.08 mg N/L (5\%) in the Appalachian Mountains. Restoration to close all buffer gaps downhill from croplands would further reduce nitrate concentrations by 0.66 mg N/L, 0.83 mg N/L, and 0.51 mg N/L, respectively, in the Coastal Plain, Piedmont, and Appalachian Mountain study watersheds. Aggregate nitrate removal by riparian buffers was less than suggested by many studies of field-to-stream transects, but buffer nitrate removal is significant, and restoration could achieve substantial additional removal.},

An important step in the mitigation of impairment in any given water body is determination of pollutant sources and amount. The sheer number of impaired waters and limited resources makes simplistic load estimation methods such as export coefficient (EC) methods attractive. Unfortunately ECs are typically based on small watershed monitoring data, which are very limited and/or often based on data collected from distant watersheds with drastically different conditions. In this research, we seek to improve the accuracy of these nutrient export estimation methods by developing a national database of localized EC for each ecoregion in the U.S. A stochastic sampling methodology loosely based on the Monte-Carlo technique was used to construct a database of 45 million Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) simulations. These simulations consider a variety of climate, topography, soils, weather, land use, management, and conservation implementation conditions. SWAT model simulations were successfully validated with edge-of-field monitoring data. Simulated nutrient ECs compared favorably with previously published studies. These ECs may be used to rapidly estimate nutrient loading for any small catchment in the U.S. provided the location, area, and land-use distribution are known.},

The Soil and Water Assessment Tool coupled with mid-21st century climate data from the Community Climate System Model were used to develop climate change scenarios for the Tuttle Creek Lake Watershed of Kansas and Nebraska. Uncertainty level of each BMP was determined using Latin Hypercube Sampling, a constrained Monte Carlo sampling technique. Samples were taken from distributions of several variables (monthly precipitation, temperature, CO2, and BMP implementation parameters). Cumulative distribution functions were constructed for each BMP, pollutant, and climate scenario combination. Results demonstrated that BMP performance uncertainty is amplified in the extreme climate scenario. Among BMPs, native grass replacement generally had higher uncertainty level but also had the greatest reductions. This study highlights the importance of incorporating uncertainty analysis into mitigation strategies aiming to reduce negative impacts of climate change on water resources.

  abstract = {Export coefficient models (ECMs) are often used to predict nutrient sources and sinks in watersheds because ECMs can flexibly incorporate processes and have minimal data requirements. However, ECMs do not quantify uncertainties in model structure, parameters, or predictions; nor do they account for spatial and temporal variability in land characteristics, weather, and management practices. We applied Bayesian hierarchical methods to address these problems in ECMs used to predict nitrate concentration in streams. We compared four model formulations, a basic ECM and three models with additional terms to represent competing hypotheses about the sources of error in ECMs and about spatial and temporal variability of coefficients: an ADditive Error Model (ADEM), a SpatioTemporal Parameter Model (STPM), and a Dynamic Parameter Model (DPM). The DPM incorporates a first-order random walk to represent spatial correlation among parameters and a dynamic linear model to accommodate temporal correlation. We tested the modeling approach in a proof of concept using watershed characteristics and nitrate export measurements from watersheds in the Coastal Plain physiographic province of the Chesapeake Bay drainage. Among the four models, the DPM was the best\textendash it had the lowest mean error, explained the most variability (R2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.99), had the narrowest prediction intervals, and provided the most effective tradeoff between fit complexity (its deviance information criterion, DIC, was 45.6 units lower than any other model, indicating overwhelming support for the DPM). The superiority of the DPM supports its underlying hypothesis that the main source of error in ECMs is their failure to account for parameter variability rather than structural error. Analysis of the fitted DPM coefficients for cropland export and instream retention revealed some of the factors controlling nitrate concentration: cropland nitrate exports were positively related to stream flow and watershed average slope, while instream nitrate retention was positively correlated with nitrate concentration. By quantifying spatial and temporal variability in sources and sinks, the DPM provides new information to better target management actions to the most effective times and places. Given the wide use of ECMs as research and management tools, our approach can be broadly applied in other watersheds and to other materials.},

However, most land surface or Earth system models do not account for the gradual changes of reservoir surface area and storage with the changing depth, inhibiting a consistent and accurate representation of mass, energy, and biogeochemical balances in reservoirs. Here we present a physically coherent parameterization of reservoir storage-area-depth data set at the global scale. For each reservoir, the storage-area-depth relationships were derived from an optimal geometric shape selected iteratively from five possible regular geometric shapes that minimize the error of total storage and surface area estimation. We applied this algorithm to over 6,800 reservoirs included in the Global Reservoir and Dam database. The relative error between the estimated and observed total storage is no more than 5\% and 50\% for 66\% and 99\% of all Global Reservoir and Dam reservoirs, respectively. More importantly, the storage-depth profiles derived from the approximated reservoir geometry compared well with remote sensing based estimation at 40 major reservoirs from previous studies and ground-truth measurements for 34 reservoirs in the United States and China. The new global reservoir storage-area-depth data set is critical for advancing future modeling and understanding of reservoir processes and subsequent effects on the terrestrial hydrological, ecological, and biogeochemical cycles at the regional and global scales.},

  abstract = {Watersheds are three-dimensional hydrologic systems where the longitudinal expansion/contraction of stream networks, vertical connection/disconnection between shallow and deep groundwater systems, and lateral connectivity of these water sources to streams mediate runoff production and nutrient export. The connectivity of runoff source areas during both baseflow and stormflow conditions and their combined influence on biogeochemical fluxes remain poorly understood. Here we focused on a set of 3.3 and 48.4 ha nested watersheds (North Carolina, USA). These watersheds comprise ephemeral and intermittent runoff-producing headwaters and perennial runoff-producing lowlands. Within these landscape elements, we characterized the timing and magnitude of precipitation, runoff, and runoff-generating flow paths. The active surface drainage network (ASDN) reflected connectivity to, and contributions from, source areas that differed under baseflow and stormflow conditions. The baseflow-associated ASDN expanded and contracted seasonally, driven by the rise and fall of the seasonal water table. Superimposed on this were event-activated source area contributions driven by connectivity to surficial and shallow subsurface flow paths. Frequently activated shallow flow paths also caused increased in-stream dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations with increases in runoff across both watershed scales. The spread and variability within this DOC-runoff relationship was driven by a seasonal depletion of DOC from continual shallow subsurface flow path activation and subsequent replenishment from autumn litterfall. Our findings suggest that hydrobiogeochemical signals at larger watershed outlets can be driven by the expansion, contraction, and connection of lateral, longitudinal, and vertical source areas with distinct runoff generation processes.},
