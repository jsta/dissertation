However, a narrow focus on lakes as discrete units is incompatible with the scale of many management programs and ignores the placement of lakes relative to their larger ecological context. While it is clear that lakes are not isolated units but are instead embedded components of lake-river networks and have a broader landscape (i.e. regional) context, it is not always clear how this embedding is borne out quantitatively. For example, is the position of a lake in a multi-lake network a dominant predictor of nutrient retention? Or, how strongly does the arrangement of streams and near-stream land-use (i.e. aquatic-terrestrial linkages) affect lake nutrient concentrations? To date, we have been unable to quantitatively address these questions in a data-driven manner because the necessary data has not previously been available for many lakes over large geographic extents (i.e. the macroscale). As a result, prior research has mostly been conducted on single lakes or in some cases groups of nearby lakes in a single region. In the following chapters, I developed several macroscale lake databases to examine hundreds to thousands of lakes across diverse local and regional settings. I used these databases to investigate the roles of both local and regional processes and aquatic-terrestrial linkages in determining lake nutrient retention, nutrient concentrations, and basic lake morphometry. In my first chapter, I show that throughout Northeastern and Midwest US, lakes with higher connectivity have lower nutrient retention but this “connectivity effect” is apparent at the scale of entire lake networks rather than more localized lake subwatersheds. My findings suggest that a broader whole-network perspective is likely to be more effective than a narrow lake-specific perspective for regulatory frameworks focused on eutrophication. In my second chapter, I show that lake nutrient concentrations are related to a variety of agricultural activity measures beyond the percent of the watershed in agricultural land use. I show that when one measure in particular, the percentage of agricultural land use in near-stream areas, is elevated; this signals a high likelihood of elevated lake nutrient concentrations. I further show that lake total phosphorus concentrations have different relationships with measures of agricultural activity relative to lake total nitrogen concentrations. My findings suggest that differences in lake nutrient sensitivity to agricultural activity may affect the outcome of policies to enhance water quality depending on whether they focus on lake N or P. In my third and final chapter, I test the utility of geometric models for predicting lake depth for all lakes. I show that one of the assumptions of such models, that slope proxies are representative of true inlake slope, is not supported by bathymetry data from 5,000 lakes. This non-representativeness has implications for predictive accuracy and model bias in lakes of different types or shapes. My findings suggest that geometric models overestimate the depth of lakes with concave cross-section shapes and those classified as reservoirs. "],

However, there is substantial variation in P retention among lakes with the same depth and residence time. One potential explanatory factor for this variation is differences in freshwater connectivity of lakes (i.e. the type and amount of freshwater connections to a lake), which can influence watershed P trapping or the particulate load fraction of P delivered to lakes via stream connections. To examine the relationship between P retention and connectivity, we quantified several different measures of connectivity including those that reflect downstream transport of material (sediment, water, and nutrients) within lake-stream networks (lake-stream-based metrics) as well as those that reflect transport of material from hillslope and riparian areas adjacent to watershed stream networks (stream-based metrics). Because it is not always clear what spatial extent is appropriate for determining functional differences in connectivity among lakes, we compared connectivity metrics at two important spatial extents: the lake subwatershed extent and the lake watershed extent. We found that variation in P retention among lakes was more strongly associated with connectivity metrics measured at the broader lake watershed extent rather than metrics measured at the finer lake subwatershed extent. Our results suggest that both connectivity between lakes and streams as well as connectivity of lakes and their terrestrial watersheds influence P retention. 1.2 Introduction Lake phosphorus (P) retention is an important characteristic of lakes that can be used to predict P concentrations and to evaluate lake sensitivity to nutrient loading and eutrophication . Specifically, P retention is an integrated measure of internal P losses including permanent sedimentation, biological uptake, and other processes that remove P from the water column . P retention has been well studied in lakes because P determines lake trophic status and downstream watershed yields (i.e. export to terminal lakes and coastal estuaries). Although previous studies have shown that lake P retention is related to water residence time , large uncertainties exist around this relationship . These uncertainties can be large in lakes with intermediate water residence times, particularly compared to lakes with either extremely short or extremely long water residence times (Figure S1.). For example, lakes with very long water residence times (on the order of a decade or longer) have complete or near complete P retention, while lakes with very short water residence times (on the order of days) have almost no P retention . The reason for the substantial uncertainty in lake P retention between these two extremes may be that predicting retention solely on the basis of water residence time does not capture many of the other factors and processes that affect P retention (Figure ). One well-studied factor that has been shown to influence lake P retention is lake depth through its influence on internal processing of P loads . The mechanism for such an influence is that lake depth controls thermal stratification and material resuspension from the benthos. As a result, shallow lakes have a tendency to mix throughout the summer causing redistribution of sedimented phosphorus throughout the mixed zone . This mixing and redistribution of sedimented P often leads to tighter benthic-pelagic coupling and increased P recycling . Thus, depth is one example of a lake characteristic that is likely to influence P retention in concert with water residence time . A primary tool for evaluating the influence of specific lake characteristics, like lake depth, on P retention is statistical phosphorus retention modelling. Although the form of such models is variable, many models estimate P retention as a function of water residence time and a parameter \\(k\\) that represents in-lake P decay . Many studies treat \\(k\\) as a constant global parameter (i.e., it has the same value for all lakes), which may be valid only for studies that consider small numbers of lakes in a limited geographic region, with similar characteristics. Few studies have modeled different \\(k\\) values based on lake or watershed characteristics, despite the many differences among lakes that likely influence their ability to process P . For example, there is evidence that the relative proportion of particulate versus dissolved P loads (hereafter, particulate load fraction), influences P retention in stream and wetland ecosystems . However, evidence for particulate load fraction controls on P retention in lakes remains limited because of difficulties in tracking the fate of particulate loads after entering a lake . Therefore, there is potential to further study particulate load Ffraction using proxies that may be closely related to it, such as the relative amounts of point and nonpoint nutrient sources to a lake subwatershed. In general, point source inputs to lakes are associated with increased dissolved P loads , whereas non-point source inputs to lakes, such as those in lake watersheds with high agricultural land use cover, typically have higher particulate P loads . Exceptions to these generalizations have been observed in areas where increased dissolved P loading occurs not as a result of point source nutrient inputs but rather as a result of non-point source runoff due to P saturated soils or legacy P release . Despite the fact that particulate loads are usually related to non-point source inputs, the fraction of non-point source inputs that are in particulate form is highly variable and may depend on intra-annual flow variations as well as watershed erosion characteristics . Furthermore, quantifying non-point source inputs at broad spatial scales is not commonly done due to logistical and sampling constraints . As a result, studies often infer the relative amounts of particulate and dissolved loading from other available proxy data such as land-use cover . Apart from land-use cover, another potential proxy for particulate load fraction entering lakes is the type and amount of freshwater connections to a lake, which we argue is easier to measure than other proxies, and could help to improve estimates of lake P retention, especially in lakes for which we lack P loading data (Figure ). Although freshwater connectivity may be easy to measure from a logistical standpoint, there are still many ways to measure connectivity that likely represent different mechanisms of water and material flow (Figure ). We broadly define and study two types of freshwater connectivity that correspond to either stream-based metrics or lake-stream-based metrics. First, lake-stream-based metrics measure the connections between a lake, other upstream lakes, and streams in their watershed. This type of connectivity can be quantified by measuring the closest distance to an upstream stream-connected lake (Figure A), or by measuring the total upstream lake area (Figure B). Second, stream-based metrics measure the connections between inflowing streams and their surrounding land whereby increasing stream connections lead to a greater abundance of land-water interfaces and greater transport of material from hillslope and riparian areas adjacent to watershed stream networks (Figure C-E). In addition to variation among connectivity metrics and connectivity metric types, it is also not always clear which spatial extent is appropriate for determining functional differences in connectivity among lakes . Such information is needed to inform the design of regulatory frameworks balancing controls on cumulative nutrient transport along stream networks and controls on localized nutrient transport . To test the importance of different spatial extents, we examined connectivity metrics measured for both the lake subwatershed extent and the lake watershed extent (Figure ). Here, the lake subwatershed extent includes the elements of the immediate watershed in the direct drainage of a lake whereas the lake watershed extent includes all of the elements in the entirety of the lake-stream network up to and including headwater streams (Figure ). We propose that measures of freshwater connectivity are related to P retention in the following ways. First, some connectivity metrics reflect the proximity of terrestrial watershed areas to the stream network . For example, lakes with a high watershed stream density should have increased particulate matter loading from terrestrial hillslope and riparian areas adjacent to watershed stream networks because particulate matter export is limited by overland distance . Second, connectivity metrics can reflect the configuration of lakes within lake-stream networks. For example, lakes with upstream lakes in close proximity may receive P loads that have previously undergone in-lake processing whereby labile fractions have already been trapped in upstream lakes . In contrast, lakes with more distant upstream lakes are more likely to receive the more labile fractions from terrestrial runoff that serve to increase P retention as opposed to receiving the more recalcitrant fractions that are resistant to biological uptake and are thus not retained. Although some connectivity metrics have an intuitive relation to P retention, it is not clear which specific measures of freshwater connectivity are important for transport of particulate matter. Therefore, our study is designed to examine and compare which measures of connectivity are more related to lake P retention. We addressed the above knowledge gaps by quantifying and comparing a range of freshwater connectivity measures at multiple spatial extents. Taken together, our suite of connectivity metrics reflect both freshwater connectivity in the direct drainage of lakes (i.e. the lake subwatershed extent) and freshwater connectivity of the entirety of the stream network up to and including watershed headwater areas (i.e. the lake watershed extent, Figure ). Our motivation for measuring connectivity so many ways is that it is easy to measure connectivity of lakes with small watersheds situated at the beginning of lake chains but it is much more challenging to identify the type and extent of connectivity in larger, more complex lake networks. Another reason we examined relationships between P retention, multiple measures of connectivity, and multiple spatial extents is that many commonly used connectivity metrics merely reflect watershed size (spatial extent) rather than types of material transport or particulate load fraction . Although lakes in larger watersheds have both a greater potential area from which to source particulate runoff and total phosphorus export from the watershed, we expect that delivery of sediment-bound phosphorus is dependent on connectivity-mediated trapping in the upstream watershed . We asked two questions in this study: 1) Which measures of freshwater connectivity influence lake phosphorus retention? 2) What spatial extent of connectivity most strongly influences P retention? To answer these questions, we fit statistical P retention models in a Bayesian hierarchical framework following where 2 separate values of the \\(k\\) processing parameter were estimated for lakes with either high or low values of each connectivity metric. Using this approach, higher \\(k\\) values for a specific lake connectivity class indicates more extensive in-lake processing and higher P retention. We applied this model to a dataset of 129 lakes across a wide range of hydrologic, geologic, and climatic settings. We fit separate models using each combination of connectivity metric and spatial extent in an effort to determine whether P retention is more strongly controlled at the lake subwatershed extent or the lake watershed extent. 1.3 Methods 1.3.1 Dataset description We used data on P retention, maximum depth, and water residence time from 129 lakes in the National Eutrophication Survey . Mean annual P loading, P discharge, and P retention values in the National Eutrophication Survey (NES) dataset were calculated based on monthly sampling for P in tributary and outlet discharge points as well as any municipal waste discharges from 1972 to 1975. Here, P retention is a unitless value representing the fraction of incoming P loads. Sampling frequency for water discharge and residence time varied among lakes but details of these variations were not provided in the source dataset . Estimates of water discharge and residence time in the NES dataset represent normalized mean flow estimates expected to occur during a period of average precipitation and hydrology . Water residence time for our study lakes ranged from 1 week to 17 years with an interquartile range of 3 months to 1.8 years while P retention ranged from 0.06 to 0.99 with an interquartile range of 0.24 to 0.59 (Table ). We supplemented the NES dataset with boundaries for lake subwatersheds, as well as estimates of stream density, upstream lake area, upstream lake connection(s), baseflow (an index of groundwater inputs), land-use cover, and other water quality measurements from the LAGOS-NE dataset . Our study lakes encompassed a wide range of land-use cover types and nutrient levels (Table ). Although, lake subwatersheds were variable with respect to agricultural land use cover, we did not observe a strong relationship with lake P retention (Figure S1.). On average, the water quality (total phosphorus, chlorophyll concentration, and Secchi depth) of the lakes in our study are similar to other US lakes as measured by the stratified random sampling design of the National Lakes Assessment (NLA) lake population . However, our lakes are substantially larger and deeper than most NLA lakes (Figure S1.). We restricted the lakes in the study to those located within the footprint of LAGOS-NE which includes lakes located in 17 northeastern and midwestern US states . We excluded lakes from our analysis if they had a surface area of greater than 1000 \\(km^{2}\\) or a surface area of less than 0.1 \\(km^{2}\\). We also excluded lakes if they had a maximum depth of greater than 70 m, lacked upstream surface water connections, or had one of the North American Great Lakes in its upstream watershed. A total of 129 out of 236 NES lakes met each of these selection criteria. 1.3.2 Connectivity metrics and spatial extents In addition to data from the NES and LAGOS-NE datasets, we calculated several connectivity metrics that we expected would be related to lake P retention (Figure ). Some of these metrics were stream-based with the goal of capturing aspects of the configuration of each lakes’ upstream surface water network (Figure C-D). In particular, we chose metrics that would quantitatively approximate network complexity under the assumption that highly complex networks are also low connectivity networks. This assumption is supported by the findings of stream network simulations where increased network complexity leads to increased network resistance and ultimately decreases in network connectivity . In addition to stream-based metrics, we calculated lake-stream-based metrics that we expected would reflect the likelihood of P trapping in upstream lakes prior to arriving at a given focal lake via tributary flow (Figure A, 2B). A simple metric that captures this likelihood is the presence (or absence) of an upstream lake (greater than 4 ha) which we define as “lake connection” . In addition to lake connection, we calculated related metrics such as total upstream lake area and the network distance to the closest upstream lake. To examine the importance of spatial extent relative to our connectivity metrics, we calculated each metric at multiple extents (Figure ). First, we calculated connectivity metrics at the scale of individual lake subwatersheds. We defined a lake subwatershed as the area draining into a particular lake exclusive of any upstream areas that drain into a lake greater than or equal to 10 ha (0.1 \\(km^{2}\\)). Next, we calculated connectivity metrics at the scale of entire upstream lake networks (lake watershed extent). We defined a lake watershed as the area draining into any part of the upstream network irrespective of the presence or absence of upstream lakes (Figure ). All connectivity metrics were calculated using the high-resolution National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) as a primary input . Average link length was calculated as the total stream length in a given watershed divided by the number of stream reaches after dissolving (removing) any network points that do not occur at a stream junction. Stream density was calculated as the length of all streams in the watershed (minus artificial lines through lakes) expressed in units of meters per hectare. Upstream lake area was calculated as the sum of the lake area in the upstream watershed expressed in square meters. Stream order ratio was defined as the number of headwater (first-order) streams in the upstream watershed of the focal lake divided by the total number of higher order (&gt; 1) streams . Closest distance to an upstream lake was defined as the shortest path-distance (rather than the straight-line distance) to a lake upstream from the focal lake. We calculated all connectivity metrics and lake watershed extents using the streamnet and nhdR R packages respectively . The algorithms in the streamnet package use the sf R package as well as the v.net and v.stream.order modules included in GRASS GIS . All processed connectivity data and code are available at . 1.3.3 Modelling lake P retention We modelled lake total phosphorus retention (hereafter, P retention) using the Vollenweider equation that models P retention as a function of water residence time and a parameter (\\(k\\)) conceptually representing in-lake P decay . Although there are several variants of this basic equation, we selected a 2-parameter form (equation ) that has been shown to have good performance in multiple cross-sectional studies : \\[\\begin{align} Ri = 1 - \\frac{1}{1 + kt^{x}_{i}} \\label{eq1.1} \\end{align}\\] where \\(R_i\\) is P retention as a fraction of P inputs, \\(\\tau\\) is water residence time, \\(k\\) is a unitless parameter representing in-lake P decay, and \\(x\\) is a unitless parameter representing P export via hydrologic flushing. Here, higher values of \\(k\\) are associated with greater integrated P losses from sedimentation and biological uptake resulting in greater P retention. Note that Eq does not include a recycling term. Therefore, our results represent net P retention (as opposed to gross P retention) under a steady state assumption where lakes are at equilibrium with respect to recycling . Note that although some forms of the Vollenweider equation use P loading as a predictor variable, it does not appear in Eq . The reason for this is two-fold. First, estimates of P loading are more difficult to obtain than estimates of water residence time and our aim was to develop a model than can be widely applied to lakes for which we lack detailed data on P loading. Second, loading based model forms have been shown to be mathematically equivalent to water residence time based model forms . We used the model described by Eq to compare lake P retention in lakes with different connectivity by fitting the model in two ways. First, we modelled the overall relationship between P retention and water residence time for all lakes in our dataset (global model). Second, we fit hierarchical versions of Eq. where \\(k\\) was modelled separately (\\(k_{j}\\)) as a function of a binary sub-population indicator \\(g_{i}\\) denoting membership in one of two lake classes formed on the basis of specific connectivity metrics (or lake depth) and specific spatial extents: \\[\\begin{align} Ri = 1 - \\frac{1}{1 + k_{j}t^{x}_{i}} \\label{eq1.2} \\\\ k_{j} = g_{i} \\end{align}\\] where greater differences in \\(k\\) between the two groups indicate greater support for a connectivity effect on P retention. Prior to model fitting, we examined the bivariate relationships between each connectivity metric, water residence time, P loading, and other factors related to P retention using Pearson’s correlation coefficients. The purpose of this exercise was twofold, to determine the potential for collinearity among any of the variables in Eq and to identify any relationships between P retention, water residence time, and other watershed and lake characteristics that were not included in our model. As only one connectivity metric was used to define \\(g\\) for each model we did not use the results of this exercise to exclude variables from further investigation. We quantified the relative support for an effect of each connectivity metric on P retention in more detail by calculating the difference in the median value of the P decay parameter \\(k\\) between groups (i.e. \\(\\Delta\\)k). We used these median \\(k\\) values along with median estimates of \\(x\\) to determine how differences in \\(k\\) translated to differences in P retention (Eq ). We judged significance by whether or not differences in group-wise P retention were greater than the measurement precision of P retention (&gt; 0.01). We fit all models in a Bayesian framework using the non-linear extension to the brms package to interface with the Stan statistical program . In both models, we set a semi-informative prior on \\(k\\) and \\(x\\) of N(1.3, 0.1) and N(0.45, 0.1) respectively. These priors were based on the confidence intervals presented in and qualitatively matched those used by . We used the default settings of brms and rstan to generate posterior estimates using four chains of 4,000 iterations each with no thinning and initial parameter values drawn from a uniform distribution bounded between -2 and 2. We also used the brms package for model evaluation by computing a Bayesian \\(R^{2}\\) following the method of . 1.3.4 Lake connectivity classes Our lake connectivity classes were formed by dividing the lake dataset into two classes for each connectivity metric based on the bivariate relationship between each metric and P retention. Prior studies have used a similar binary splitting approach to examine the effect of various exogenous factors on lake P retention . We determined splitting criteria for each metric from the results of a random forest procedure incorporating conditional inference trees . This procedure creates binary splits of the independent variables (i.e. each of the connectivity metrics), which are recursively repeated to find the split that maximizes association with the dependent variable (P retention). The advantage of the ctree technique over the more typical classification-regression tree (CART) technique is that tree growth stopping rules are pre-specified . As a result, some of subjectivity associated with post-hoc tree pruning is avoided. 1.4 Results 1.4.1 Interactions between connectivity, hydrology, and P loading We examined the bivariate relationships between connectivity, water residence time, P loading and other factors related to P retention to determine the potential for strong relationships among any of the variables which were not accounted for by our model structure (Eq , Figure ). We found evidence for some relationships among these variables, but none that suggest either redundancy among connectivity metrics or that otherwise limit our ability to infer relationships with P retention (Figure ). For example, the Pearson correlation (r) between water residence time and stream density, which is implicitly accounted for in our model structure, was 0.29 (p &lt; 0.05). In contrast, the correlation between water residence time and upstream lake area, which is unaccounted for in our model structure, was only 0.10 (p &gt; 0.05). Note that interactions between connectivity metrics and water residence time are accounted for in our hierarchical model structure because Eq. uses a global coefficient \\(x\\) for water residence time that is estimated separately from the hierarchical and connectivity-dependent P decay coefficient k. This is conceptually similar to fitting the k-connectivity-P retention relationship to the residuals of the water residence time to P retention relationship. Perhaps surprisingly, we did not observe strong correlations between P loading and water residence time (r = 0.13, p &gt; 0.05) or between lake depth and most connectivity metrics (r &lt; 0.17). This suggests that our P retention results are not confounded by variations in lake depth, by interactions between connectivity and P loading, or by interactions between water residence time and P loading. A secondary purpose of examining the bivariate relationships between connectivity, water residence time, P loading and other factors related to P retention was to determine if our connectivity metrics were related to each other such that they provide similar information. With the exception of stream density and baseflow (r = -0.52, p &lt; 0.05), correlations among connectivity metrics were low and of a similar magnitude as the correlations between connectivity metrics and water residence time (0.10 &lt; r &lt; 0.29). The strongest correlation between any connectivity metric or lake characteristic was upstream lake area and lake watershed area (r = 0.77, p &lt; 0.05). We observed notably strong correlations between P loading and several lake characteristics not accounted for in Eq . These include the correlation between P loading and lake watershed area (r = 0.62, p &lt; 0.05) as well as the correlation between P loading and lake subwatershed area (r = 0.76, p &lt; 0.05). In addition, the correlation between P loading and upstream lake area was quite strong (r = 0.52, p &lt; 0.05). Despite strong correlations between P loading, watershed area, and upstream lake area, we did not observe a strong correlation between P loading and P retention (r = 0.15, p &gt; 0.05). Notably, this correlation was much weaker than the correlation between water residence time and P retention (r = 0.44, p &gt; 0.05). Our observation that the correlation between P retention and P loading was not appreciably stronger than correlations between P retention and our connectivity metrics suggests that our estimates of connectivity metric effects on P retention are not confounded by interactions between water residence time and P loading. Although we did not observe strong correlations among connectivity metrics, we found that lakes with similar connectivity metric values, were spatially clustered (Figure ). In particular, we found that lakes were concentrated in either the southern or northern portions of our study area depending on their connectivity metric value (Figure ). This observation is consistent with the findings of that lakes in the northern portion of our study area have distinct freshwater connectivity as compared to lakes in the southern portion of our study area. 1.4.2 Effects of connectivity on P retention We found that freshwater connectivity metrics were associated with lake P retention (Figure , ). Across all connectivity metrics except stream order ratio, we found that the P decay coefficient \\(k\\) and thus P retention was associated with whether a lake had a high or low value of each connectivity metric. These findings matched our expectations in several ways. Most notably, lakes with shorter average link lengths had higher P retention relative to lakes with longer average link lengths. In addition, lakes with less upstream lake area had higher P retention than lakes with more upstream lake area (Figure , ). We found that some connectivity metrics were more strongly related to P retention than others. For example, the model \\(R^{2}\\) for network average link length was higher (\\(R^{2}\\) = 0.41) than the global model (\\(R^{2}\\) = 0.34). For other connectivity metrics, such as network stream order ratio, goodness-of-fit (\\(R^{2}\\) = 0.36) was very similar to the global model (\\(R^{2}\\) = 0.34). Model fit for other connectivity metrics was in between these two extremes (0. 36 &lt; \\(R^{2}\\) &lt; 0.41). Overall, we found that all hierarchical models had at least a marginally better fit to the water residence time versus P retention relationship than a global model which does not account for connectivity (Figure ). Although we found a discernable effect of connectivity metrics on lake P retention, the somewhat modest improvements in model fit may be due to the fact that water residence time remains a dominant effect even after accounting for freshwater connectivity. 1.4.3 Comparison across connectivity metrics and spatial extent Differences in P retention among lakes with different connectivity metric values was reflected in differences among connectivity class-specific values of the P decay parameter \\(k\\) (Figure ). The connectivity metric that had the most effect on \\(k\\) was average link length (Table ). For instance, hierarchical models fit with the average link length metric had a median effect size of 0.23 and 0.05 for \\(k\\) and P retention respectively (Table ), which means that for this metric, lakes with shorter average link lengths retained 4.7 to 4.9% more P than lakes with longer average link lengths. The influence of lake-stream-based connectivity metrics on lake P retention was similar to stream-based connectivity metrics (Figure ). This suggests that both lake-stream-based connectivity between lakes and streams as well as stream-based connectivity of lakes and their terrestrial watersheds influence P retention (Figure ). We found that connectivity metrics measured at the lake watershed extent were more strongly associated with P retention than metrics measured at the lake subwatershed extent (Table , Figure ). Specifically, the metrics that had the strongest association with P retention such as average link length (\\(\\Delta\\)k = 0.23), closest lake distance (\\(\\Delta\\)k = 0.22), and stream density (\\(\\Delta\\)k = 0.20) also had a stronger association at the lake watershed extent rather than at the lake subwatershed extent (Table , Figure ). An exception to this pattern was observed with the baseflow connectivity metric where although greater differences at the lake subwatershed extent were more strongly associated with P retention, the sign of the effect was variable depending on measurement extent (i.e. the value of the P decay parameter was positively related to connectivity metric values at the subwatershed extent but was negatively related at the watershed extent). For several connectivity metrics, we judged that differences in P decay among lakes with either low or high connectivity metric values were not significant because they translated to differences in P retention that were less than measurement precision (Table ). 1.5 Discussion Although prior studies have found that lake P retention is related to water residence time , there is substantial variation around this relationship, particularly at intermediate water residence times. We found that some of this remaining variation could be explained using a hierarchical modelling framework that accounts for differences in freshwater connectivity among lakes. Although we found that the magnitude of this effect depends on the specific connectivity metric, our results are consistent with the findings of previous studies showing that connectivity metrics are associated with differences in lake carbon input fluxes and differences in lake nitrogen output fluxes . We also found important differences in the association between connectivity metrics and P retention at different measurement extents. Specifically, we found that P retention was more strongly associated with connectivity measured at the broader lake watershed extent rather than connectivity measured at the finer lake subwatershed extent. 1.5.1 Connectivity and P retention We found that differences in P retention among lake connectivity classes was influenced by specific connectivity metrics including average link length, closest lake distance, and stream density (Table , Figure ). Indeed, these metrics were more strongly associated with P retention than covariates typically used in statistical P retention models (e.g. lake depth, Figure ). Note that we were able to examine the influence of specific metrics as separate effects apart from water residence time because our model structure treats them as hierarchical coefficients on the P decay parameter \\(k\\). As a result, although water residence time remains the dominant effect on lake P retention, we were able to estimate the specific influence of each metric in a way that is not possible using integrated water residence time and connectivity metrics such as watershed transport capacity . Several of the connectivity metrics that were most strongly associated with P retention were weakly correlated with watershed size (Figure ). The weak nature of these correlations are consistent with the mixed results of prior studies linking watershed size to lake processes. For example, found that carbon export was related to watershed size, but found that the nitrogen flux was not strongly related to watershed size. Taken together, our results and the results of prior studies suggest that watershed size and lake depth alone may not always reflect functional differences in potential material transport. One consequence of a correlation between connectivity metrics and watershed size is that metrics derived from watershed size, such as catchment to lake area ratio, are also likely to be associated with connectivity. Catchment to lake area ratio in particular has been previously used as an approximation or proxy of water residence time . Although our results differ from those of who found that the presence of an upstream lake connection was not strongly associated with catchment to lake area ratio, our results suggest that catchment to lake area ratio likely incorporates some connectivity information and caution is needed before using it as a proxy for water residence time. Another lake characteristic that was strongly related to watershed size was P loading. In particular, positive correlations between P loading and watershed size are consistent with the idea that lakes in larger watersheds receive greater P loading . A related observation is that the correlation between P loading and upstream lake area was positive. This can be explained by the fact that larger watersheds often have greater numbers of lakes nested within them . Another notable result is that we observed a weaker correlation between P loading and watershed area relative to the correlation between P loading and subwatershed area. One explanation for this result is that land-use cover at the finer lake subwatershed extent has more of an influence on P loading than land-use cover at the broader lake watershed extent . 1.5.2 Relative importance of connectivity spatial extent One of the challenges in quantifying the effect of freshwater connectivity on lake P retention is that it is not always known what spatial extent of the watershed is functionally connected to a lake. We found that connectivity at the broader lake watershed extent rather than connectivity at the finer lake subwatershed extent was more strongly associated with differences in lake P retention. In addition, we found that individual characteristics such as lake depth (or more discrete measures of connectivity such as the presence of an upstream lake) were more strongly associated with P retention than any of the other connectivity metrics measured at the lake subwatershed extent (Table ). These findings contrast with who examined the association between lake nutrient concentrations (as opposed to retention) and land-use measured at varying spatial extents and found that measurements at the finer lake subwatershed extent rather than measurements at the broader lake watershed extent were more strongly associated with lake nutrient concentrations. One explanation for the difference between our results and those of is that connectivity metrics may reflect long-range watershed processes to a greater degree than land-use cover. An alternative explanation is that controls of lake P retention may differ compared to controls on lake P concentration. 1.5.3 How connectivity metrics may influence P retention Prior studies at regional extents have shown that P retention in streams and rivers is largely determined by the fate of the particulate load fraction . For instance, the findings of show that riverine P loads can be controlled by nonpoint-source P delivery of particulate P. Therefore, it stands to reason that P retention in lakes may also be largely determined by the fate of the particulate load fraction. However, in the context of our broad-scale study it is difficult to examine this relationship because although we have estimates of nonpoint versus point source loading we do not have explicit estimates of particulate load fraction for large numbers of lakes. Unfortunately, we cannot use nonpoint source loading as a direct proxy for particulate load fraction because the two quantities do not have a consistent relationship. For example, report that the particulate phosphorus fraction of nonpoint source loads can be anywhere between 62 - 90% while report that this fraction can be anywhere between 33 and 80%. This may explain why prior broad scale studies that estimate lake P retention have not attempted to estimate separate effects of particulate versus dissolved loading . We developed a conceptual model that places particulate load fraction in context with other processes affecting P retention (Figure ). We expected that both land-stream and stream-lake connectivity influences how much particulate P is transported into lakes, which in turn affects their P retention. This expectation is supported by the findings of as well as showing that particulate P can be transported beyond the direct drainage from stream-adjacent hillslopes. Despite our inability to test such differential transport processes across many lake watersheds at broad scales, we note that such processes are indirectly supported by our finding that connectivity metrics are associated with lake P retention. For example, differential transport of particulate matter whereby barriers to flux and differences in drainage path configuration only become apparent beyond fine spatial extents may explain why we observed stronger association of P retention with metrics measured at the broader lake watershed extent rather than metrics measured at the finer scale lake subwatershed extent. Another finding consistent with differential transport of particulate P is our observation that average link length, which approximates stream network structure and along-stream transport potential , was one of the more strongly associated metrics with lake P retention. Finally, it is notable that our stream density metric was influential at the lake watershed extent but not at the lake subwatershed extent. Given that the stream density metric captures the average distance or drainage potential between any streams in the network and their adjacent hillslopes, floodplains, and wetlands , this suggests that differences in terrestrial runoff of particulate matter from hillslope and riparian areas are likely to be important for P retention. Taken together, our findings are consistent with the idea that both connectivity between lakes and streams as well as connectivity of lakes and their terrestrial watersheds affect lake P retention. This conclusion matches that of prior studies showing that aquatic transport of phosphorus and nitrogen at the sub-continental scale is strongly controlled by processes affecting along-stream flux such as reservoir trapping . 1.6 Conclusion We provide evidence that freshwater connectivity has an effect on lake P retention and that connectivity metrics measured at the broader lake watershed extent more strongly captures functional differences in the effect of connectivity on P retention among lakes compared to connectivity metrics measured at the finer lake subwatershed extents. Furthermore, our results suggest that lake P retention is related to both connectivity of lakes and streams as well as connectivity of lakes and their terrestrial watersheds. Taken together, our findings suggest that a broader network perspective would be useful for the design of regulatory frameworks and the development of best management practices focused on eutrophication, given the importance of lake P retention in determining the trophic state of lakes. Specifically, our findings highlight the need to consider cumulative network effects of P transport in addition to localized transport mechanisms. 1.7 Supplemental information It is difficult to examine the uncertainties surrounding the relationship between water residence time and lake P retention because empirical measures of these quantities do not exist for many lakes. One of the few comprehensive sources of these data is modelling studies which produce largely unverified estimates of water residence time and P retention (Milstead et al. 2013). Such model output data may not be appropriate for statistical P retention modelling because P retention and water residence time values are not independently estimated. As an alternative, we performed a more qualitative analysis fitting separate smoothed functions to lakes of differing connectivity (see appendix source code for details). Specifically, we used the connectivity data provided in LAGOS-NE (Soranno and et 2017) and described in detail by (Fergus et al. 2017) where lakes are grouped based on whether they have upstream lake connections (DR_LakeStream), or upstream stream connections (DR_Stream), are headwater lakes, or are isolated lakes. Our study lakes encompassed a range of land-use cover types and nutrient levels. Here, we examined whether a strong relationship of lake P retention with agricultural land use cover could be obscuring relationships with connectivity metrics. We used P retention data from the National Eutrophication Survey (Stachelek et al. 2017) and land cover data from the 1992 National Land Cover Database clipped to lake watersheds and available in the LAGOS-NE dataset (Soranno and et 2017). Although our study considered many lakes spread across a broad spatial extent, we wanted to assess whether their basic characteristics were representative of lakes in general. We compared water quality (total phosphorus, chlorophyll concentration, and Secchi depth) of the lakes in our study with other US lakes as measured by the stratified random sampling design of the National Lakes Assessment (NLA) lake population (USEPA 2016). Our lakes are similar in most respects except that they are substantially larger and deeper than most NLA lakes. References "],

For lakes, evidence for these associations mostly comes from studies on individual lakes or watersheds that relate concentrations of nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P) to aggregate measures of agricultural land-use, such as the proportion of land used for agriculture in a lake’s watershed. However, at macroscales (i.e., in hundreds to thousands of lakes across large spatial extents), there is high variability around such relationships and it is unclear whether considering more granular (or detailed) agricultural data, such as fertilizer application, planting of specific crops, or the extent of near-stream cropping, would improve prediction and inform understanding of lake nutrient drivers. Furthermore, it is unclear whether lake N and P would have different relationships to such measures and whether these relationships would vary by region, since regional variation has been observed in prior studies using aggregate measures of agriculture. To address these knowledge gaps, we examined relationships between granular measures of agricultural activity and lake total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations in 928 lakes and their watersheds in the Northeastern and Midwest U.S. using a Bayesian hierarchical modelling approach. We found that both lake TN and TP concentrations were related to these measures of agriculture, especially near-stream agriculture. The relationships between measures of agriculture and lake TN concentrations were more regionally variable than those for TP. Conversely, TP concentrations were more strongly related to lake-specific measures like depth and watershed hydrology relative to TN. Our finding that lake TN and TP concentrations have different relationships with granular measures of agricultural activity has implications for the design of effective and efficient policy approaches to maintain and improve water quality. 2.2 Introduction Freshwaters are vulnerable to eutrophication in areas of high agricultural land-use and land cover because agricultural activities are associated with high nutrient runoff and loading to groundwater and streams . High runoff and loading in these areas is a result of high rates of nutrient input combined with hydrologic modifications that decrease the travel time of these inputs from the land surface to lakes . Surprisingly, while some studies have found strong relationships between agricultural land-use and land cover (hereafter referred to as “land-use” or LULC) and lake nutrient concentrations , others have found more mixed results , particularly in studies that include many lakes located in multiple regions . Further examples of such macroscale studies (see ) in which lakes are spread across many regions at distances spanning hundreds to thousands of kilometers include and , who found that the strength of agriculture and lake nutrient relationships varied depending on geographic region and lake characteristics. Mixed results from prior studies may be due to two difficulties in quantifying lake nutrient and agricultural land-use relationships. First, the pathways of nutrients from fields to streams and ultimately to lakes are complex and indirect . For example, in order for nitrogen applied as fertilizer to reach a lake, it must be transported to streams or groundwater in excess of microbial denitrification, plant use, and microbial uptake. Then, it must travel, again, often undergoing repeated chemical transformation as it passes through riparian buffers and along stream networks before finally entering the lake . Each step of the journey represents an opportunity for those nutrients to be sequestered or removed. Further, overall hydrologic transport is influenced by soil type , and topography. Thus, the nutrients that ultimately enter a lake are a function of filtering by the landscape as well as geochemical transformation processes that are difficult to capture at broad scales . Second, much of our evidence for a connection between agricultural land-use and increased nutrient concentrations comes from studies focusing on a single watershed or on several watersheds within a single geographic region . These studies tend to focus on very detailed measures of agricultural activity such as tillage and other practices, nutrient amendments, and their spatial arrangement. However, studies at broader spatial scales (i.e., the macroscale, , which aim to provide a more general view of relationships between lake nutrient concentrations and agriculture, tend to focus only on relatively coarse measures of agricultural activity . As a result, it is unclear to what extent the mixed results from prior broad-scale studies might be due to the limited use of detailed measures of agricultural activity or simply from regional variation. There are two ways in which detailed (i.e., granular) measures of agricultural activity may be substituted for their coarse (i.e., aggregate) counterparts. The first is by using granular measures that are recorded in the same locations as their aggregate equivalents but are more descriptive. For example, in broad-scale studies, the proportion of land used for agriculture in a lake watershed is sometimes replaced by separate representations of the land used for pasture and the land used for row-crops . The second is by using granular measures that have the same description as their aggregate equivalents, but that are measured in more specific locations. For example, a small number of lake studies have compared the proportion of land used for agriculture in near-stream buffers versus the watershed as a whole . Although the term granular can be used in a general sense to describe any detailed agricultural measure, we define the term more narrowly as only those that have a specific aggregate counterpart (Table ). Prior use of granular data in broad-scale studies of lake water quality has been limited. For this reason, findings from broad-scale studies may be less useful in applied management settings because coarse (i.e. aggregate) land-use and land cover change metrics have become less widely used policy instruments . Instead, recent policy interventions go beyond aggregate measures of agricultural activity to target more specific measures such as implementation of specific farming practices, no-till agriculture, and construction of riparian buffer strips . Thus, broad-scale studies could be made more relevant for informing policy interventions if they used covariates that have a similar level of granularity to those used in fine-scale studies. For example, implementation of no-till agriculture policies may be better informed by covariates at the granular crop level rather than solely by aggregate covariates like land used for agriculture (Figure S2.). One likely reason that broad-scale studies have rarely used granular agricultural data is that until recently, such data have not been available with corresponding lake nutrient concentration data over large geographic extents. Although a few examples exist of studies connecting granular agricultural data to either stream nitrogen or phosphorus concentrations at the macroscale , most studies have focused on either nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P) but not on both at the same time . Crucially, we are not aware of prior work examining relationships between a multiple granular measures of agricultural activity on either lake N or P concentrations at macroscales. There are several plausible expectations, which are based on the findings of broad-scale stream studies as well as the findings of fine-scale lake studies, for the type of relationships between such measures and lake nutrient concentrations that may emerge at macroscales. First, we expect that increased nutrient inputs to the land surface as fertilizer and manure will increase lake nutrient concentrations . Second, we expect that lakes with watersheds that have high soil clay content and high soil organic carbon content will have higher lake nutrient concentrations. This will occur because clay soils tend to have higher rates of surface runoff and have higher organic matter content relative to sandy soils, despite the tendency for higher organic matter content to increase water storage and reduce surface runoff . Finally, we expect that lakes with stream networks characterized by extensive near-stream agriculture will have higher nutrient concentrations because there will be less interception of agricultural runoff . Although we can formulate potential expectations for relationships between agricultural activities and lake nutrients at the macroscale by building on the findings of prior studies, several key uncertainties remain. The first key uncertainty is the extent to which lake and watershed characteristics, such as watershed hydrology and soil type, affect relationships between granular measures of agricultural activity and lake nutrient concentrations at the macroscale. For example, macroscale studies have found that lake P concentrations are strongly dependent on lake depth , but the degree to which granular agricultural data provide additional explanatory power is unknown. Similarly, found that watershed to lake area ratio (i.e. lake water residence time) was positively related to lake N concentrations after controlling for aggregate measures of agricultural land-use, but it is unknown whether this mediation effect would also affect relationships with more granular measures of agriculture. The second key uncertainty is the extent to which relationships between granular measures of agricultural activity and lake nutrient concentrations vary regionally. For example, previous macroscale studies on lake nutrient concentrations have found that relationships between lake chlorophyll and nutrient concentrations vary regionally according to hydrologic subregions . Models in which separate relationships (e.g. slopes) are estimated for different regions, such as those used by , can be used to test differences among regions in the sensitivity to nutrient predictors. found that the slope of the chlorophyll to P relationship was notably higher in several of their study regions and found that lakes with high pasture land-use in their watershed were more sensitive to changes in P concentrations (larger, positive slope estimate). They suggest that elevated sensitivity in high pasture regions is due to dual N and P nutrient enrichment associated with this land cover type. Given the findings of this and other studies in stream ecosystems , it follows that other relationships in lakes may vary regionally, but whether or not this includes relationships with granular measures of agricultural activity remains unknown. We addressed the knowledge gaps described above by asking two questions using data from approximately 900 lakes in the Northeastern and Midwestern US: 1) How do granular measures of agricultural activity relate to lake N and P concentrations? And, 2) How do relationships between agricultural activities and lake nutrients vary regionally among hydrologic and climatic regions? To answer these questions, we fit statistical models of lake nutrient concentrations as a function of granular measures of agricultural activity such as the proportion of watershed area land-use of specific crops, and near-stream land-use, as well as fertilizer and manure applications. We also included a variety of lake and watershed characteristics as predictors to account for the influence of other drivers. Finally, our models included a hierarchical component where relationships between watershed land-use and lake nutrient concentrations were allowed to vary among hydrologic subregions to examine potential regional variation in these relationships. 2.3 Methods 2.3.1 Data description We analyzed data on lake total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations from the LAGOS-NE data product . The LAGOS-NE nutrient data are limited to surface (or “epilimnetic”) samples and were derived from federal, state, tribal, and non-profit agencies, as well as university researchers and citizen scientist data collections . We collapsed lake nutrient data to long-term median values computed using all data from the summer stratified period (i.e. 15 June through 15 September) available for each lake between 2000 and 2010. For the lakes that met our selection criteria (see below) the median number of samples per lake was nine (range = 3-94) and the median number of years sampled was four (range = 2-10). Our first source for granular agricultural information was the 2010 Cropland Data Layer (CDL, ), which we used to generate lake watershed and stream buffer estimates of the proportion of land cover due to specific crops such as corn and soybeans. We used the R package cdlTools to access CDL products . We used the 2010 CDL data because this was the first year of high resolution (30 x 30m) CDL data collection that matched our lake nutrient data collection window. Because the CDL contains detailed coverage for dozens of crops, including rare crops with little to no coverage, we re-categorized CDL data based on to a more limited set of categories (Table S2.). As a more granular representation of watershed agricultural land use, we measured the proportion of land cover in agricultural and “natural” land-uses in 100-m buffers of lake shorelines and streams for each lake watershed. We chose a 100-m buffer width because this width is inclusive of nearly all “riparian buffers” . Here agricultural land-use is defined in the aggregate sense as the proportion of land used for agriculture in a lake’s watershed whereas “natural” land-uses include the sum of all non-agriculture and non-developed CDL classes. We identified the streams associated with each lake using the stream network extraction tool in the nhdR interface to the National Hydrography Network . We compiled soil characteristics for each lake watershed using the Gridded Soil Survey Geographic Database (gSSURGO, ) where we used the python package gssurgo to access gSSURGO products. One such product was wetland potential, defined as the percentage of the soil grid that meets the criteria for hydric soils formed under conditions of saturation, flooding, or ponding long enough to develop anaerobic conditions but not so long as to be classified as a permanent waterbody . Finally, we compiled mean annual nutrient inputs via fertilizer and manure to lake watersheds from 1982-2001 using county level data provided by . We spatially aligned these county level estimates to lake watershed polygons provided by LAGOS-NE using the area-weighted interpolation functions provided by the sf R package . All of our data and data processing code are available at . 2.3.2 Location information We restricted the lakes included in the study to those located within the footprint of LAGOS-NE which includes lakes located in 17 Northeastern and Midwest U.S. states . We excluded lakes from our analysis if they had a surface area &gt; 400 \\(km^2\\) or a maximum depth &gt; 35 m. These removals resulted in exclusion of approximately 40 lakes which we regarded as outliers that would likely have undue influence on model results because such large and deep lakes are likely to respond differently to enrichment as a result of enhanced stratification. To ensure an adequate comparison between aggregate and granular measures of agriculture, we further limited lakes in our study to those with at least 10% of the total watershed area devoted to agricultural land-use and those that were sampled at least three times between 2000 and 2010. A total of 928 lakes met these selection criteria (Figure ). Because we focused on lakes in agricultural watersheds, more than 35 percent of lakes in our study are considered eutrophic to hypereutrophic using chlorophyll a as a diagnostic versus only 15 percent for all lakes from located within our study extent (Figure S2.). For the regional terms in our models, we used hydrologic regions at the subbasin (i.e. HUC4) level because this level was small enough to give a sense of overall spatial variation but large enough to encompass sufficient numbers of lakes to estimate within region variance. 2.3.3 Model overview We evaluated the effects of agricultural activities on lake TN and TP concentrations using a Bayesian hierarchical modelling approach. A list of lake and watershed covariates with their summary statistics is available in Table . In the first part of our model evaluation, we compared models that each had only a single measure of watershed land-use along with all remaining non-watershed land-use predictors. These non-watershed land-use predictors were included in every fitted model and were defined as measures of near-stream land-use, soil characteristics, and lake and watershed characteristics. We took this approach of evaluating one watershed land-use measure at a time for two reasons: 1) because measures of watershed land-use were highly correlated, and 2) because it allowed us to more rigorously test our expectation that granular measures of agriculture provide additional explanatory power beyond that offered by more typical aggregate measures of agriculture. In the second part of our model evaluation, we selected the top-ranked watershed land-use model according to our selection criteria for lake N and P (see below) for further inspection of their standardized coefficient values (See Table ). Our models were of the form: \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} y_i = N(\\alpha_{j(i)} + \\beta_1 &amp;* X_{1i}...\\beta_n * X_{ni} + \\gamma_{1j(i)} * W_{1i} + \\gamma_{mj{i}} * W_{mi})\\\\ &amp; \\binom{\\alpha_j}{\\gamma_{1j}} \\sim MVN\\left( \\binom{\\mu_\\alpha}{\\mu_{\\gamma1}}, \\Sigma \\right) \\label{eqn2.1} \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\\] where yi is either TN or TP concentration for lake i, and \\(\\beta\\) are “global” (i.e. fixed effect) coefficients. This set of global coefficients included estimates for watershed soil characteristics, near-stream land-use, as well as fertilizer and manure inputs for each lake (\\(X_i\\)). Whereas \\(\\beta\\) coefficients were estimated as fixed effects, \\(\\gamma\\) coefficients and \\(\\alpha\\) intercepts were estimated as varying (i.e. random) slopes and intercepts respectively among m hydrologic regions j on watershed land-use (\\(W_{ij}\\)). Region specific intercepts \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\gamma\\) slopes were assumed to come from a multivariate normal distribution (MVN) where \\(\\mu_\\alpha\\) and \\(\\mu_{\\gamma1}\\) are their respective grand mean (i.e., population level) estimates. We tested a variety of watershed land-use types for \\(W_{ij}\\), including both granular and more aggregate measures of agricultural activity. Our only aggregate measure of agricultural activity was agricultural land-use whereas we used several granular measures of agricultural activity. These included both detailed measures of watershed land-use such as corn and soybean cover as well as more detailed measures of nutrient inputs and near-stream land-use (Table ). We included measures of both N and P inputs in both N and P models because of the possibility for stoichiometric interaction. Given our regularization scheme (i.e. our use of “horseshoe priors” described below) there was little reason to exclude P inputs from N models (and vice versa) because unless P inputs are strongly related to lake TN concentration, their coefficient will be forced close to zero. All models had the same set of fixed effect coefficients while each individual model used a single different watershed land-use variable as a random effect. This modelling strategy is supported by our view that watershed land-use is an indirect proxy (sensu ) for other unquantifiable agricultural activities. Therefore, we expect the makeup of specific activities represented by this indirect measure to vary regionally. This contrasts with other predictor variables e like lake depth, where we have little evidence from prior studies that its effect on lake nutrient concentrations is spatially variable. Prior to model fitting, we examined the bivariate relationships between lake nutrient concentrations and all predictor variables using Pearson’s correlation coefficients (Figure A5) to determine the overall structure of the predictor dataset. We did not use the results of this exercise for building our model, performing model selection, or variable selection. For qualitative analysis of our model results, we classified predictor variables following into categories based on the dominant mechanism affecting lake nutrient concentrations, which includes nutrient inputs, nutrient transport, spatial configuration of land-use in stream buffers (Spatial config.), lake characteristics, and watershed land-use (LULC). We fit all models in a Bayesian framework using the brms R package interface to the Stan statistical program . We used horseshoe shrinkage priors on all fixed effect coefficients to evaluate variable importance . We considered a response variable sensitive to a given predictor if the predictor’s 95% credible interval did not overlap 0. We standardized all predictor variables by subtracting the mean of each variable and dividing by their respective standard deviation so that model coefficients could be compared on roughly the same scale. As a result, the relative sensitivity of a response variable to a particular predictor is related to the relative magnitude of its coefficient estimate. We evaluated model fit of each watershed land-use variable (i.e., each model having one regionally varying coefficient) in two ways. First, we computed a Bayesian \\(R^2\\) following the method of and second, we computed differences in expected log predictive density (ELPD) using the leave-one-out cross e validation routines provided by the loo R package and implemented in brms . The loo package uses leave-one-out cross validation to estimate overall model error by computing the average error of models iteratively trained on all the data except for a single point. ELPD values have a similar interpretation to information criterion measures such as Akaike information criterion (AIC) or Watanabe-Akaike information criterion (WAIC) except that values are on a different scale . Typically, models are considered to be different if they are separated by an AIC value of greater than 2 , which is equivalent to an ELPD value of -1 . We report differences in ELPD among models using the notation \\(\\Delta\\)ELPD. We selected the model with the lowest absolute value ELPD as the “top-ranked” model for detailed reporting and discussion as this signifies the model with the lowest leave one out cross-validation error for N and P respectively. We used the default settings of brms to generate posterior estimates using four chains of 4,000 iterations each with no thinning and discarding the first 1,000 iterations. We examined model fits to ensure that all models had acceptable convergence of MCMC chains and had approximately normal model residuals. We further tested for spatial correlation among model residuals using the spind R package . All of our code for model fitting and evaluation is available at . 2.4 Results 2.4.1 Effects of agriculture on lake nitrogen and phosphorus Lake characteristics (e.g., maximum depth and watershed to lake area ratio) along with measures of nutrient transport (e.g., baseflow) and near-stream agriculture were significant predictors in all lake N and P models that we fit. When we compared among different models for each nutrient individually, we found that those with agricultural watershed land-use (in the aggregate sense) were top-ranked (i.e., had the lowest absolute value leave-one-out cross validation score) for models of both TN and TP concentrations (Figure , Table ). Although we observed no difference in the specific watershed land-use predictor used in each top-ranked model, we found differences in the extent to which each top-ranked model was substantially different from lower ranked models. For example, in the case of P, all models had nearly identical \\(R^2\\) (0.63) and the difference between the top-ranked model and second ranked model was modest (\\(\\Delta\\)ELPD = 0.41). For N models, however, agricultural and corn land-use models had higher \\(R^2\\) (0.58) compared to other models and the difference between the top-ranked and second ranked model was more substantial (\\(\\Delta\\)ELPD = 2.58, Figure , Table ). When we looked more closely at each top-ranked model, we found similarities in the types of predictors that contributed significantly to the top-ranked N and P models (Figure ). First, both N and P models included measures of lake characteristics such as maximum depth and watershed to lake area ratio as significant predictors, with the sign of these associated coefficients matching our conventional understanding, in which shallower lakes and lakes with greater hydrologic loads have higher TN and TP concentrations. Second, both models included measures of nutrient transport such as baseflow and precipitation, in which lakes with a “flashier” hydrology (i.e., having lower baseflow) where incoming water is primarily from surface runoff rather than from groundwater, had higher TN and TP concentrations. Finally, both models indicated that high near-stream agriculture (i.e., a high proportion of the area adjacent to the stream network was in agricultural land-use) was associated with lakes having higher TN and TP concentrations. Where N and P models differed was in the effect of soil clay content, in which soils with low clay content were associated with high lake N but had no significant relationship with P. Although top-ranked N and P models shared some similarities in the type of predictors that contributed significantly to each model, the coefficients of these models differed in magnitude, and thus the top-ranked models varied in their sensitivity to specific predictors (Figure ). For example, the top-ranked P model was more sensitive to lake characteristics, whereas the top-ranked N model was more sensitive to watershed land-use. Quantitatively, lake TP concentrations were more sensitive to maximum depth (\\(\\beta_{depth}\\): median = -0.39, SD = 0.04) compared to lake TN concentrations (\\(\\beta_{depth}\\): median = -0.14, SD = 0.04); whereas lake TN concentrations were more sensitive to watershed agriculture land-use (\\(\\beta_{ag}\\): median = 0.44, SD = 0.11) compared to lake TP concentrations (\\(\\beta_{ag}\\): median = 0.10, SD = 0.08). Finally, although we found that near-stream agriculture was associated with both higher TN and TP concentrations (i.e., a source-effect of near-stream agriculture), there was not a significant difference in the magnitude (i.e., sensitivity) of this coefficient between N (\\(\\beta_{bufferag}\\): median = 0.16, SD = 0.06) and P (\\(\\beta_{bufferag}\\): median = 0.12, SD = 0.06) models. No predictors in the nutrient input category appeared to be strongly related to either TN or TP concentrations. One explanation may be that these variables co-varied with watershed and near-stream land-use variables (Figure A5). In an attempt to further investigate this possibility, we fit alternative models excluding all land-use predictors. The results show that, at least in the case of N, removing these predictors caused model variance to be apportioned from watershed and buffer land-use predictors to N input and P fertilizer predictors (Figure A4). However, this non-land-use N model had a relatively poor fit (\\(R^2\\) = 0.40) compared to the top-ranked model that included land-use as a predictor (\\(R^2\\) = 0.58). 2.4.2 Regional variation in agriculture sensitivity Both TN and TP concentrations were sensitive to measures of watershed land-use as well as near-stream agriculture (Figure , Table ). Despite these similarities, we found differences in both the magnitude of these effects and the extent to which we observed regional variation in watershed land-use sensitivity for N and P models (Figure ). For P, there was little evidence that sensitivity to watershed land-use was regionally variable. More specifically, the credible intervals for the slope of each individual region overlapped the global slope estimate (Figure ). In contrast, for N we found evidence for regional variation in sensitivity to watershed land-use. For this nutrient, the credible intervals for 2 of the 37 regions did not overlap the global estimate (Figure ). These regions were found in parts of Iowa, Minnesota, and Illinois and appear to be more sensitive to watershed land-use – i.e., lake N increases at a faster rate per unit increase in agricultural land-use compared to other regions (Figure ). The median soil clay content of watersheds in these regions was higher than the median across watersheds in all other regions (Figure ). Furthermore, these two regions had a unique combination of both high soil clay content and extensive tile drainage (Figure S2.). 2.5 Discussion 2.5.1 Effects of granular measures of agriculture on lake nitrogen and phosphorus There is substantial unexplained variation around simple linear relationships between aggregate representations of watershed land-use in agriculture and both lake N and P (Figure S2.). Our study was designed to examine these relationships in greater detail by testing whether more granular measures of agriculture could help explain some of this uncertainty for both N and P, and whether there were regional differences in these relationships. In sum, all models for TN and TP concentrations included at least one granular measure of agriculture, but there were also important differences between N and P related to the type of measures that were important to each. For example, we found little benefit of increased granularity of description (i.e., where measures are recorded in all the same locations as their aggregate equivalents) but consistent benefit of granular representation of the spatial configuration of land-use in near-stream buffers. 2.5.2 Spatial configuration The result showing that lake TN and TP concentrations are sensitive to the spatial configuration of land-use in near-stream buffers is consistent with our expectation and prior research. Specifically, our finding that model coefficients on near-stream agriculture (i.e., agricultural land-use in stream buffers) in all N and P models were significant and positive indicates a nutrient-delivery effect of stream buffer agriculture and suggests that the spatial configuration of agriculture with respect to stream buffers has a detectable influence on both lake N and P at macroscales. This is consistent with prior studies conducted over more limited spatial extents which examined relationships between lake or stream nutrient concentrations and agricultural land-use in stream buffers . In contrast to near-stream agriculture, we found that near-stream “natural” land-use was not significant in either N or P models. While we cannot definitively answer why, it may be related to the role that natural buffers play in nutrient cycling for N and P . In the case of N, natural buffers may reduce stream loading by facilitating denitrification, whereas, in the case of P, natural buffers may trap particulate bound material without necessarily removing it . An alternative possibility is that we are observing a scale effect whereby the delivery effect of near-stream agriculture is spatially consistent whereas the trapping and removal effects of N and P by natural buffers is more spatially variable . Finally, we may not have observed a protective effect of natural buffers because natural land-use in buffers is too coarse of a proxy for “riparian buffers” composed of forest or herbaceous vegetation . 2.5.3 Crop type We found that for N models, land-use of specific crops was significant, although it was not found in the top-ranked model. Specifically, we found that watershed land-use in corn production was a significant predictor in the second-ranked N model (Table ). In the case of P by contrast, neither aggregate nor granular measures of watershed land-use were significant in any models (Figure ). This can be explained by our finding that all watershed land-use metrics had weak relationships with lake P, especially relative to the strong relationships we observed between P and other factors like lake depth, hydrology, and near-stream agricultural land-use. Here, our finding is consistent with prior studies in stream ecosystems showing that the influence of hydrology exceeds that of agricultural land-use or anthropogenic P inputs . 2.5.4 Nutrient inputs None of the nutrient input variables were significant for either N or P models. On the surface, this would seem to contradict the findings of prior research such as that of , who found that stream TN concentrations were more strongly controlled by N input predictors relative to measures of either watershed or near-stream land-use. However, our finding has several alternative explanations. First, differences between our lake study and the stream study may simply point to differences in the controls on stream nitrogen concentrations relative to lake nitrogen concentrations . Second, our finding that N and P were insensitive to nutrient input variables may be a result of shared variance between nutrient input variables and watershed land-use. This makes sense given that agricultural land-uses and corn land-use in particular are associated with high rates of fertilizer and manure application . To test this explanation, we formulated N models without a watershed land-use term and observed that model variance was transferred from watershed land-use to the nutrient input terms total N input and P fertilizer (Figure S2.). While the positive coefficient on total N input has a straightforward interpretation, the negative coefficient on P fertilizer is unclear. Rather than evidence of a true inverse relationship between P fertilizer and N (or evidence for stoichiometric interaction sensu , we interpret the negative coefficient on P fertilizer as evidence of either model misspecification (i.e., model fit was poor compared to the model with land-use because N was very sensitive to land-use) or as evidence of multicollinearity among nutrient input variables (Figure S2.). Thus, we think that it is likely that the removal of one of the key drivers of N (being land-use) caused model variance to be transferred to nutrient input predictors generally such that the specific highlighting of P fertilizer is a result of noise rather than a true relationship. 2.5.5 Nutrient transport An important category of predictors in our models was nutrient transport. For example, we found that baseflow was a significant predictor in all N but especially all P models. This is consistent with prior research at macroscales showing the sensitivity of lake nutrients to this metric . In contrast to baseflow, we found that watershed soil clay content was a significant predictor in all N models but not in any P models. Furthermore, we found that the coefficient on soil clay content was negative, which was contrary to our expectation, and prior research. It seems to suggest a negative correlation between clay content and N. However, upon closer inspection, we did not find evidence for such a relationship. Instead, we found evidence for a non-linear relationship, which may explain the negative coefficient on clay, whereby clay and TN were positively correlated over most of the range of watershed clay content but were negatively correlated in watersheds with very high soil clay content (&gt; 20%; Figure S2.). This non-linear relationship may be an artifact of the specific non-random sampling of our lakes whereby the lakes with extremely high soil clay content watersheds happen to have extremely long water residence times leading to extensive removal of N loads due to denitrification . Overall, granular measures of agriculture were significant in both N and P models. However, the contribution of such measures relative to other non-agricultural predictors was greater for N models (Figure , Figure ). One reason why granular measures of agricultural activity had a greater effect on N models may be that variation in N is less effectively captured solely by lake and watershed characteristics owing in part to the more complex nature of transformations in the nitrogen cycle. This finding is consistent with that of and who found that lake depth coefficients were of a much higher magnitude for P relative to N. This is expected since depth strongly controls internal P loading (i.e., recycling), which is a dominant control on lake phosphorus dynamics . 2.5.6 Regional variation in agriculture–nutrient relationships The macroscale nature of our study motivated our second research question examining how relationships between agricultural activities and lake nutrients vary regionally. This is because recent research has shown that analyzing macroscale lake datasets without considering the possibility of regionally varying relationships runs the risk of drawing imprecise or incorrect conclusions because it can lump together lakes with fundamentally different responses to a given predictor variable . Additionally, we looked at this question because prior studies have shown regional variation in the relationship of lake nutrient concentrations to aggregate measures of agriculture . In our study, we found mixed evidence for regional variation in relationships with watershed land-use, depending on the lake nutrient response variable. For N, we found evidence for regional variation whereby lakes in two of the 37 regions were more sensitive to changes in agricultural land-use relative to other regions. The reasons for this elevated sensitivity are unclear, but one possible reason may be that watersheds in these more sensitive regions had higher median soil clay content than the median soil clay content of watersheds in less sensitive regions (Figure ). Higher soil clay content in particular may ultimately control the nitrogen content of field runoff because it is associated with more direct (i.e., tile) drainage. For example, maps produced by suggest that our more sensitive regions correspond roughly with areas where field exports of nutrients are likely to bypass trapping by riparian buffers. As evidence of this association, data from indicate that watersheds in these two sensitive regions had a unique combination of high soil clay content and extensive tile drainage (Figure S2.). For P, we found no evidence for regional variation in its relationship with watershed land-use. This finding, that watershed land-use can be modelled as a global (fixed) effect, is consistent with that of , who found no statistically significant differences in region-specific relationships between lake P and agricultural land-use. However, it is inconsistent with that of , who found regionally variable relationships between lake P and agricultural land-use using a multilevel modelling framework. One reason that both our analysis and the study did not observe regional variation in the watershed land-use versus P relationship may be that P is so strongly controlled by lake depth that there is little additional explanatory power offered by including a watershed land-use term. In addition, if lake P is controlled primarily by lake depth, which we can assume does not change with time, then our results may explain the finding of that lake P trends are spatially consistent whereas lake N trends have distinct regional variability. 2.5.7 Management implications Knowledge of differences in the drivers of lake N and P can support the design of effective and efficient policy approaches to maintain or improve water quality. For instance, our finding of regional variation in the relationship between lake TN concentrations and watershed land-use in agriculture suggests spatial targeting of best management practices (BMPs) to specific regions known to be highly sensitive . In addition, our finding of strong relationships between lake TP concentrations and lake characteristic predictors contrasts with the strong relationships we observed between watershed land-use and lake TN. Given that watershed land-use, rather than lake characteristics, is a more feasible management target, our results suggest that the cost-effectiveness of BMPs could differ depending on whether the goal is to protect against excess N, P, or both . For P, our analysis suggests that nutrient control policies are likely to be especially effective in shallow lakes and lakes with low baseflow (i.e., those with flashier hydrology). Conversely, phosphorus control in deeper lakes and reservoirs with long residence times will likely require recovery efforts in addition to prevention efforts due to the long time-scales of stored (i.e., legacy) P . In contrast to P, our results show that lake TN concentrations are more sensitive to watershed land-use. This suggests that policies to enhance the use of BMPs to reduce N inputs to lakes are likely to require a greater degree of stakeholder involvement, possibly through consideration of tradeoffs between land retirement and working lands programs . 2.5.8 Future research priorities Due to a lack of temporally resolved data, our study focused on spatial patterns in sensitivity of lake TN and TP concentrations to measures of agricultural activity and did not examine the possibility that such relationships could be temporally variable. A consequence of this was that we assumed that relationships between lake N and P relative to agricultural drivers did not change over our data collection window (2000 - 2010). However, there are several instances where time may be important, and these would likely be fruitful areas for future research. For example, showed marked conversion of conservation reserve program (CRP) lands to cropland throughout the footprint of our study from 2008 to 2012. Such changes in land-use could make it more difficult to quantify lake sensitivity to agriculture if relationships vary through time especially if relationships are subject to threshold effects . A more subtle illustration of when time may be important is when field-scale nutrient export is highly dependent on episodic hydrology. For example, a number of previous studies have shown that field-scale nutrient export of N is greatest when a series of dry years is followed by a wet spring . It might make sense then to organize modeling around whether lake watersheds are generally subject to slowflow, fastflow, or drainflow nutrient transport rather than solely taking a spatial regionalization approach (i.e., using HUCs). Barriers to more detailed temporal approaches include greater demands of spatio-temporally resolved data products. Overall, our results point to hydrology predictors like baseflow as an instance where we only have spatially coarse information and development of more granular estimates of watershed hydrology, possibly using the output of hydrology models, would likely improve future research efforts. 2.6 Conclusion We show that granular measures of agricultural activity are related to both lake N and P and that these relationships are regionally variable for lake N. Taken together, our results suggest that lake TP concentrations are more strongly driven by lake characteristics; whereas, lake TN concentrations are more strongly driven by watershed land-use. A consequence of our finding is that lake TP concentrations are largely predictable from lake-specific measures such as near-stream land-use, lake depth, and transport metrics like baseflow; whereas, accurate predictions of lake N likely requires not only lake specific information (including granular measures of agriculture) but also consideration of regional context due to complex regional variation of soil characteristics. Such differences in lake nutrient model sensitivity to measures of agricultural activity may affect the outcome of policies to enhance water quality depending on whether they focus on lake N or P. 2.7 Supplemental information "],

As a result, our ability to understand and predict important depth-dependent processes for all lakes is limited. Lake depth prediction studies to date have generally taken one of two approaches 1) a statistical approach relating depth to map-derived predictors like lake area or 2) a geometric approach where depth is calculated analytically (e.g. using trigonometry) after fitting lakes to some geometric shape based on survey-derived predictors like lake volume. While there is some evidence to suggest that a geometric approach produces more accurate depth estimates, the data requirements of such models mostly preclude out-of-sample depth prediction. As an alternative, we investigated the possibility that map-derived parameters could serve as proxies for the more difficult to obtain survey-derived parameters required by geometric models. To this end, we developed a simple geometric model of lakes with two survey-derived (i.e. calculated from bathymetry) parameters, a horizontal measure (deepest point distance) and a vertical measure (inlake slope) each having a corresponding map-derived proxy (visual center distance and nearshore slope respectively). We constructed random forest models on approximately 5,000 lakes in 9 U.S. States where we fit calculated (i.e. “true”) maximum depth as a function of analytically derived maximum depth using different combinations of map-derived proxies. Our models included a variety of additional map-derived parameters such as lake area and perimeter to account for the possibility that other non-proxy metrics might be related to depth. We found that depth prediction errors were at their lowest when models included a true slope measure (inlake slope) whereas we observed little benefit to having a true distance measure (deepest point location). Furthermore, we observed that predictions from models lacking a true slope covariate systematically overpredicted lake depth in concave (i.e. bowl-shaped lakes) and reservoir lakes. Our results suggest that global estimates of lake depth are likely overestimated. "],
["conclusion-2.html", "Conclusion Research Frontiers Future Directions", " Conclusion Research Frontiers Each of the preceding chapters left some analyses unexplored that represent emerging research frontiers in macroscale lake research. For instance, In Chapter 1 I used lake connectivity metrics to quantify the effect of connectivity among lakes and streams as well as connectivity of lakes and their terrestrial watersheds on lake P retention. However, “connectivity” is a somewhat nebulous idea that is difficult to quantify with specific metrics. For instance, I found that not all metrics can be mapped onto a “high connectivity” versus “low connectivity” gradient. A potential alternative to this messy mapping of connectivity onto discrete metrics is to compare the drainage pattern of a given stream network against an optimal drainage pattern which has the highest possible connectivity for a given watershed. A recent tool, the OCNet R package, may facilitate exactly such calculations as it can calculate the optimal distributions of upstream and downstream lengths, contributing area, and the space-filling attributes of specific watersheds (Carraro et al. 2020). In Chapter 2, I examined relationships between lake nutrient concentrations and measures of agricultural activity quantified at varying levels of spatial and process-level detail. This effort was limited in the types of agricultural measures that were considered owing to the spatial extent of the study, challenges in data integration of diverse data types, and complicated model interpretation and building. For instance, it would have been great to have included other aspects of agriculture like animal feeding operations. Unfortunately, the limited spatial resolution of this data (only to county level) made it difficult to integrate with crop and nutrient input data. In addition, I was unable to explore temporal variation in lake nutrient-agriculture relationships which may have contributed to overall model uncertainty. Unfortunately, few lakes have adequate nutrient concentration time series data to drive such a model. Furthermore, assembly of agricultural covariates through time is a significant challenge. In Chapter 3, I tested the assumptions of geometric models of lake depth using bathymetry data. I show that such models are highly sensitive to imperfect proxies of lake slope. Even with measures of true slope derived from bathymetry, model prediction accuracy is still barely accurate enough to distinguish between “shallow” and non-shallow lakes. A fruitful area of future research would be to test different modeling techniques such as ordinal modeling (i.e. shallow versus not shallow) and new topobathymetric data products that integrate topographic and bathymetric data into a single product. This may boost predictive power and avoid changes in resolution and changes in scale that likely introduce uncertainty in model predictions. Future Directions I developed each of the preceding chapters using a landscape limnology and macrosystems ecology approach with the following steps 1) Identify an aspect of lake ecology that has not been explored at broad spatial extents, 2) Develop a conceptual model linking lake characteristics to different components of the freshwater landscape taking into account variation across spatial scales, and 3) Formulate statistical or machine learning models to test this conceptual model. My general aim was to check if generally accepted intuition about the functioning of individual lakes holds at the macroscale across hundreds to thousands of spatially distant lakes. Throughout this process I noticed several commonalities amongst each dissertation chapter. One commonality among dissertation chapters was the sheer number of modeling choices that underpin each result. My hope is that the most important of these choices is reflected in the text and the remaining ones are sufficiently documented in the code supplements accompanying each chapter. In some cases, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to explore the sensitivity of my model results to each choice. However, the sheer number of these choices made it intractable to test them all. Choices such as what type of regionalization to use or how and when to aggregate data from one spatial scale to another were not always straightforward. Future exploration of these choices would likely go a long way in strengthening our understanding of spatial patterning of lake characteristics at macroscales and generating exciting new research questions. A second commonality I found was that models incorporating spatial variation are very often superior in terms of predictive performance and model fit relative to non-spatial models. However, I only really interrogated one level of spatial variation, which was variation within and among hydrologic subbasins. The question of why two neighboring lakes might differ in terms of trophic status despite having nearly identical land-use, nutrient loading, morphometry, and climate remains largely unresolved by my analyses. Answering this question may require the application of new techniques such as those that consider spatial autocorrelation within stream networks or new data types derived from the output of fine-scale hydrologic models. Exploring these is likely to be critical for resolving the types of local-scale spatial variation which is so important for the management of freshwater ecosystems. "]
