<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Dataset description</h2>
<p>We used data on P retention, maximum depth, and water residence time from 129 lakes in the National Eutrophication Survey . Mean annual P loading, P discharge, and P retention values in the National Eutrophication Survey (NES) dataset were calculated based on monthly sampling for P in tributary and outlet discharge points as well as any municipal waste discharges from 1972 to 1975. Here, P retention is a unitless value representing the fraction of incoming P loads. Sampling frequency for water discharge and residence time varied among lakes but details of these variations were not provided in the source dataset . Estimates of water discharge and residence time in the NES dataset represent normalized mean flow estimates expected to occur during a period of average precipitation and hydrology . Water residence time for our study lakes ranged from 1 week to 17 years with an interquartile range of 3 months to 1.8 years while P retention ranged from 0.06 to 0.99 with an interquartile range of 0.24 to 0.59 (Table ).</p>

<p>We supplemented the NES dataset with boundaries for lake subwatersheds, as well as estimates of stream density, upstream lake area, upstream lake connection(s), baseflow (an index of groundwater inputs), land-use cover, and other water quality measurements from the LAGOS-NE dataset . Our study lakes encompassed a wide range of land-use cover types and nutrient levels (Table ). Although, lake subwatersheds were variable with respect to agricultural land use cover, we did not observe a strong relationship with lake P retention (Figure S1.). On average, the water quality (total phosphorus, chlorophyll concentration, and Secchi depth) of the lakes in our study are similar to other US lakes as measured by the stratified random sampling design of the National Lakes Assessment (NLA) lake population . However, our lakes are substantially larger and deeper than most NLA lakes (Figure S1.).</p>
<p>We restricted the lakes in the study to those located within the footprint of LAGOS-NE which includes lakes located in 17 northeastern and midwestern US states . We excluded lakes from our analysis if they had a surface area of greater than 1000 <span class="math inline">\(km^{2}\)</span> or a surface area of less than 0.1 <span class="math inline">\(km^{2}\)</span>. We also excluded lakes if they had a maximum depth of greater than 70 m, lacked upstream surface water connections, or had one of the North American Great Lakes in its upstream watershed. A total of 129 out of 236 NES lakes met each of these selection criteria.</p>

<div id="connectivity-metrics-and-spatial-extents" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Connectivity metrics and spatial extents</h2>
<p>In addition to data from the NES and LAGOS-NE datasets, we calculated several connectivity metrics that we expected would be related to lake P retention (Figure ). Some of these metrics were stream-based with the goal of capturing aspects of the configuration of each lakes’ upstream surface water network (Figure C-D). In particular, we chose metrics that would quantitatively approximate network complexity under the assumption that highly complex networks are also low connectivity networks. This assumption is supported by the findings of stream network simulations where increased network complexity leads to increased network resistance and ultimately decreases in network connectivity . In addition to stream-based metrics, we calculated lake-stream-based metrics that we expected would reflect the likelihood of P trapping in upstream lakes prior to arriving at a given focal lake via tributary flow (Figure A, 2B). A simple metric that captures this likelihood is the presence (or absence) of an upstream lake (greater than 4 ha) which we define as “lake connection” . In addition to lake connection, we calculated related metrics such as total upstream lake area and the network distance to the closest upstream lake.</p>
<p>To examine the importance of spatial extent relative to our connectivity metrics, we calculated each metric at multiple extents (Figure ). First, we calculated connectivity metrics at the scale of individual lake subwatersheds. We defined a lake subwatershed as the area draining into a particular lake exclusive of any upstream areas that drain into a lake greater than or equal to 10 ha (0.1 <span class="math inline">\(km^{2}\)</span>). Next, we calculated connectivity metrics at the scale of entire upstream lake networks (lake watershed extent). We defined a lake watershed as the area draining into any part of the upstream network irrespective of the presence or absence of upstream lakes (Figure ).</p>
<p>All connectivity metrics were calculated using the high-resolution National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) as a primary input . Average link length was calculated as the total stream length in a given watershed divided by the number of stream reaches after dissolving (removing) any network points that do not occur at a stream junction. Stream density was calculated as the length of all streams in the watershed (minus artificial lines through lakes) expressed in units of meters per hectare. Upstream lake area was calculated as the sum of the lake area in the upstream watershed expressed in square meters. Stream order ratio was defined as the number of headwater (first-order) streams in the upstream watershed of the focal lake divided by the total number of higher order (&gt; 1) streams . Closest distance to an upstream lake was defined as the shortest path-distance (rather than the straight-line distance) to a lake upstream from the focal lake.</p>
<p>We calculated all connectivity metrics and lake watershed extents using the <code>streamnet</code> and <code>nhdR</code> R packages respectively . The algorithms in the <code>streamnet</code> package use the <code>sf</code> R package  as well as the <code>v.net</code> and <code>v.stream.order</code> modules  included in GRASS GIS . All processed connectivity data and code are available at .</p>

<div id="modelling-lake-p-retention" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Modelling lake P retention</h2>
<p>We modelled lake total phosphorus retention (hereafter, P retention) using the Vollenweider equation that models P retention as a function of water residence time and a parameter (<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>) conceptually representing in-lake P decay . Although there are several variants of this basic equation, we selected a 2-parameter form (equation ) that has been
shown to have good performance in multiple cross-sectional studies :</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
  Ri = 1 - \frac{1}{1 + kt^{x}_{i}} \label{eq1.1}
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span> is P retention as a fraction of P inputs, <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> is water residence time, <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is a unitless parameter representing in-lake P decay, and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is a unitless parameter representing P export via hydrologic flushing. Here, higher values of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> are associated with greater integrated P losses from sedimentation and biological uptake resulting in greater P retention. Note that Eq  does not include a recycling term. Therefore, our results represent net P retention (as opposed to gross P retention) under a steady state assumption where lakes are at equilibrium with respect to recycling . Note that although some forms of the Vollenweider equation use P loading as a predictor variable, it does not appear in Eq . The reason for this is two-fold. First, estimates of P loading are more difficult to obtain than estimates of water residence time and our aim was to develop a model than can be widely applied to lakes for which we lack detailed data on P loading. Second, loading based model forms have been shown to be mathematically equivalent to water residence time based model forms .</p>
<p>We used the model described by Eq  to compare lake P retention in lakes with different connectivity by fitting the model in two ways. First, we modelled the overall relationship between P retention and water residence time for all lakes in our dataset (global model). Second, we fit hierarchical versions of Eq.  where <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> was modelled separately (<span class="math inline">\(k_{j}\)</span>) as a function of a binary sub-population indicator <span class="math inline">\(g_{i}\)</span> denoting membership in one of two lake classes formed on the basis of specific connectivity metrics (or lake depth) and specific spatial extents:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
  Ri = 1 - \frac{1}{1 + k_{j}t^{x}_{i}} \label{eq1.2} \\
  k_{j} = g_{i}
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>where greater differences in <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> between the two groups indicate greater support for a connectivity effect on P retention. Prior to model fitting, we examined the bivariate relationships between each connectivity metric, water residence time, P loading, and other factors related to P retention using Pearson’s correlation coefficients. The purpose of this exercise was twofold, to determine the potential for collinearity among any of the variables in Eq  and to identify any relationships between P retention, water residence time, and other watershed and lake characteristics that were not included in our model. As only one connectivity metric was used to define <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> for each model we did not use the results of this exercise to exclude variables from further investigation. We quantified the relative support for an effect of each connectivity metric on P retention in more detail by calculating the difference in the median value of the P decay parameter <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> between groups (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>k). We used these median <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> values along with median estimates of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to determine how differences in <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> translated to differences in P retention (Eq ). We judged significance by whether or not differences in group-wise P retention were greater than the measurement precision of P retention (&gt; 0.01).</p>
<p>We fit all models in a Bayesian framework using the non-linear extension to the <code>brms</code> package to interface with the Stan statistical program . In both models, we set a semi-informative prior on <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> of N(1.3, 0.1) and N(0.45, 0.1) respectively. These priors were based on the confidence intervals presented in  and qualitatively matched those used by . We used the default settings of <code>brms</code> and <code>rstan</code> to generate posterior estimates using four chains of 4,000 iterations each with no thinning and initial parameter values drawn from a uniform distribution bounded between -2 and 2. We also used the <code>brms</code> package for model evaluation by computing a Bayesian <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}\)</span> following the method of .</p>
</div>
<div id="lake-connectivity-classes" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Lake connectivity classes</h2>
<p>Our lake connectivity classes were formed by dividing the lake dataset into two classes for each connectivity metric based on the bivariate relationship between each metric and P retention. Prior studies have used a similar binary splitting approach to examine the effect of various exogenous factors on lake P retention . We determined splitting criteria for each metric from the results of a random forest procedure incorporating conditional inference trees . This procedure creates binary splits of the independent variables (i.e. each of the connectivity metrics), which are recursively repeated to find the split that maximizes association with the dependent variable (P retention). The advantage of the ctree technique over the more typical classification-regression tree (CART) technique is that tree growth stopping rules are pre-specified . As a result, some of subjectivity associated with post-hoc tree pruning is avoided.</p>
