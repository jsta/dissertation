Lakes are classically viewed as discrete ecosystems bounded on all sides by land. This view of lakes has persisted despite much research into the role of lakes in the freshwater continuum and the recognition that lake nutrient budgets and many other factors are affected by both local and regional processes. While it is clear that lakes are not isolated units but are instead embedded components of lake-river networks and have a broader landscape context, it is not always clear how this embedding is borne out quantitatively. For example, is the position of a lake in a multi-lake network a dominant predictor of nutrient retention? Or, how strongly does the arrangement of streams relative to watershed components affect lake nutrient concentrations? One of the reasons why we lack quantitative evidence addressing these types of questions is that previous research has mostly been conducted on single lakes or in some cases groups of nearby lakes in a single region. Rather, what is needed to address these knowledge gaps is comprehensive and broad-scale analyses of hundreds to thousands of lakes across diverse local and regional settings. To address these knowledge gaps, I investigated the roles of both local and regional processes and aquatic-terrestrial linkages in determining lake nutrient retention, nutrient concentrations, and basic lake morphometry using broadscale datasets. I have three components to my dissertation research.
First, I examined how the number and types of physical connections influence lake nutrient retention. I show that throughout Northeastern and Midwest US, lakes with higher connectivity have lower nutrient retention but this “connectivity effect” is apparent at the scale of entire lake networks rather than more localized lake subwatersheds. My findings suggest that a broader whole-network perspective is likely to be more effective than a narrow lake-specific perspective in regulatory frameworks focused on eutrophication. Second, I examined how lake nutrient concentrations are related to a variety of agricultural activity measures beyond the percent of the watershed in agricultural land use. I show that one measure in particular, the lack of riparian buffer signals a high likelihood of elevated lake nutrient concentrations. I further show that lake total phosphorus concentrations have different relationships with measures of agricultural activity relative to lake total nitrogen concentrations. My findings suggest that dual nutrient control strategies in agricultural landscapes should consider such relationships to control eutrophication. Third, I examined how lake depth is related to lake and watershed characteristics particularly those that can only be calculated from bathymetry data. I use high resolution bathymetry data to show that lake maximum depth is more reliable than mean depth, depth prediction error is sensitive to imprecise measurements of slope, and the depth of U-shaped lakes is overestimated not because they have steeper slopes but because they are shallower. Furthermore I show that lake cross section shape is more strongly related to proxies for lake hydrology rather than the slope of the land surrounding a lake. These findings underscore the fact that lake depth as it is used in predictive models of lake nutrients serve as a stand-in for otherwise missing hydrology information.
Taken together, my research points to the importance of hydrology in determining lake nutrient retention and concentrations. As a result, I see the next frontier in lake nutrient modelling as the challenge of incorporating more detailed, accurate, and fine scale measures of hydrology. This is something that is somewhat common in studies at limited spatial extents but can become intractable at broad spatial extents particularly if the output of hydrology models is excluded or unavailable.

It’s cliche to say you’ve stood on the shoulders of giants but maybe it’s just this type of elevated perspective that’s needed to see how the pieces fit together - to see how lakes are related to each other - and to see how lakes are related to their ecological context. The shoulders I’ve stood on include of course my advisor, Pat Soranno, as well as the other members of our lab Kendra Cheruvelil, Katelyn King, Ian McCullough, Autumn Poisson, Nick Skaff, and Nicole Smith whose support has been much appreciated. I would also like to thank my remaining committee members Drs Elise Zipkin and Dana Infante who provided excellent advice and direction on this Dissertation journey. As a group, I would like to thank the members of the Continental Limnology and CNH Lakes Projects whose diversity of perspectives provided much needed context for my research. Also, thank you to everyone from the numerous  federal, state, tribal, and non-profit agencies, as well as university researchers and citizen scientist data collectors and curators whose data unpin my research. Finally, I would like to thank Sheena Stachelek and the rest of my family for their love and encouragement.

Lakes are classically viewed as discrete ecosystems bounded on all sides by land. This framing has served as a useful organizing principle particularly with regard to the study of specific waterbodies. However, a narrow focus on lakes as discrete units is incompatible with the scale of many management programs and ignores the links between lakes and their larger ecological context \citep{likensLinkagesTerrestrialAquatic1974}. In recognizing these limitations, a specific focus of modern limnology has been on further integrating ecological context in the study of lakes. Notable concepts and frameworks developed as part of these efforts include aquatic-terrestrial linkages \citep{likensLinkagesTerrestrialAquatic1974}, the freshwater continuum \citep{vannoteRiverContinuumConcept1980}, landscape limnology \citep{sorannoUsingLandscapeLimnology2010}, and macrosystems ecology \citep{heffernanMacrosystemsEcologyUnderstanding2014}. \par

Despite much progress, several limiting factors have prevented a more full consideration of lakes relative to their ecological context. Foremost of these has been limited data availability.  It is common for studies to consider the ecological context of lakes relative to their watersheds for a single lake or several lakes within a single geographic region. However, it is far less common for studies to consider many lakes across multiple regions (i.e. at macroscales) where distances span hundreds to thousands of kilometers (but see \citet{usepa1975}, \citet{landers1988eastern}, and \citet{usepa_nla2012}). A consequence of the mostly narrow focus on relatively few lakes is that we lack the perspective necessary to formulate general relationships between lakes and their ecological context that hold beyond a single lake or region. A further limiting factor preventing a fuller consideration of lake ecological context has been lack of data analysis techniques that both account for and leverage spatial variability at these scales. Such techniques are necessary to account for the multiple interacting drivers of the lake ecological status that often occur at varying spatial scales \citep{allanLandscapesRiverscapesInfluence2004}. \par

Thus throughout my Dissertation, I accounted for uncertainty and spatial variability among lakes and regions using modern data analysis techniques. My aim was to statistically scale and extrapolate conventional understanding of lakes gained from studies at limited spatial extents to a more diverse set of lakes representative of continental-scale gradients. In general, the research questions in each of my chapters are related to these two overarching questions 1) How strongly are in-lake measures, which are difficult to obtain and available for limited numbers of lakes, related to different map-derived measures, which are easier to obtain for large numbers of lakes? 2) How do these relationships vary when computed or examined over different spatial extents?
