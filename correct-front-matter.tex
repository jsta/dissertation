Lakes are classically viewed as discrete ecosystems bounded on all sides by land. However, a narrow focus on lakes as discrete units is incompatible with the scale of many management programs and ignores the placement of lakes relative to their larger ecological context. While it is clear that lakes are not isolated units but are instead embedded components of lake-river networks and have a broader landscape (i.e. regional) context, it is not always clear how this embedding is borne out quantitatively. For example, is the position of a lake in a multi-lake network a dominant predictor of nutrient retention? Or, how strongly does the arrangement of streams and near-stream land-use (i.e. aquatic-terrestrial linkages) affect lake nutrient concentrations? To date, we have been unable to quantitatively address these questions in a synthetic manner because the necessary data has not previously been available for many lakes over large geographic extents (i.e. the macroscale). As a result, prior research has mostly been conducted on single lakes or in some cases groups of nearby lakes in a single region. In each of the following chapters, I developed macroscale lake databases to examine hundreds to thousands of lakes across diverse local and regional settings and used these databases to investigate the roles of both local and regional processes and aquatic-terrestrial linkages in determining lake nutrient retention, nutrient concentrations, and basic lake morphometry.

    In my first chapter, I show that throughout Northeastern and Midwest US, lakes with higher connectivity have lower nutrient retention but this “connectivity effect” is apparent at the scale of entire lake networks rather than more localized lake subwatersheds. My findings suggest that a broader whole-network perspective is likely to be more effective than a narrow lake-specific perspective in regulatory frameworks focused on eutrophication. In my second chapter, I show that lake nutrient concentrations are related to a variety of agricultural activity measures beyond the percent of the watershed in agricultural land use. I show that when one measure in particular, the percentage of agricultural land use in near-stream areas, is elevated, this signals a high likelihood of elevated lake nutrient concentrations. I further show that lake total phosphorus concentrations have different relationships with measures of agricultural activity compared to lake total nitrogen concentrations. My findings suggest that differences in lake nutrient sensitivity to agricultural activity may affect the outcome of policies to enhance water quality depending on whether they focus on lake N or P. In my third and final chapter, I test the utility of geometric models for predicting lake depth for lakes with missing depth information. Using bathymetric data for 5,000 lakes, I show that one of the assumptions of such models, that slope proxies of the surrounding land are representative of true in-lake slope, is not supported by available evidence. This lack of relationship has implications for predictive accuracy and model bias in lakes of different types or shapes. My findings specifically suggest that geometric models are likely to overestimate the depth of lakes with concave cross-section shapes and those classified as reservoirs. Across all chapters, I use the frameworks of landscape limnology and macrosystems ecology to explore the relationships between watershed and lake characteristics. I show that such macroscale analyses, which explicitly consider hierarchy in the freshwater landscape, provide a nuanced understanding of controls on lake nutrients and morphometry across a broad array of lakes.

It’s cliche to say you’ve stood on the shoulders of giants but maybe it’s just this type of elevated perspective that’s needed to see how the pieces fit together - to see how lakes are related to each other - and to see how lakes are related to their ecological context. The shoulders I’ve stood on include of course my advisor, Pat Soranno, as well as the other members of our lab Kendra Cheruvelil, Katelyn King, Ian McCullough, Autumn Poisson, Nick Skaff, and Nicole Smith whose support has been much appreciated. I would also like to thank my committee members Drs Elise Zipkin and Dana Infante who provided excellent advice and direction on this Dissertation journey. As a group, I would like to thank the members of the Continental Limnology and CNH Lakes Projects whose diversity of perspectives provided much needed context for my research. Also, thank you to everyone from the numerous federal, state, tribal, and non-profit agencies, as well as university researchers and citizen scientist data collectors and curators whose data unpin my research. Finally, I would like to thank Sheena Stachelek and the rest of my family for their love and encouragement.

Lakes are classically viewed as discrete ecosystems bounded on all sides by land \citep{golley1993history}. This framing has served as a useful organizing principle particularly with regard to the study of specific waterbodies \citep{oneillITTIMEBURY2001}. However, a narrow focus on lakes as discrete units is incompatible with the scale of many management programs and ignores the links between lakes, their aquatic-terrestrial linkages, and their larger ecological context \citep{likensLinkagesTerrestrialAquatic1974, sorannoUsingLandscapeLimnology2010a}. In recognizing these limitations, a specific focus of modern limnology has been on further integrating freshwater and terrestrial environments connected to and surrounding lakes (i.e. their ecological context). Frameworks developed as part of these efforts include landscape limnology \citep{sorannoUsingLandscapeLimnology2010a} and macrosystems ecology \citep{heffernanMacrosystemsEcologyUnderstanding2014} that call for explicit consideration of hierarchy in the freshwater landscape and interactions across time and space among hierarchy levels.\par

Despite these efforts, several limiting factors have prevented a more full consideration of lakes relative to their ecological context. Foremost of these has been limited data availability.  It is common for studies to consider the ecological context of lakes relative to their watersheds for a single lake or several lakes within a single geographic region. However, it is far less common for studies to consider many lakes across multiple regions (i.e. at macroscales) where distances span hundreds to thousands of kilometers (but see \citet{usepa1975}, \citet{landers1988eastern}, and \citet{usepa_nla2012}). A consequence of the mostly narrow focus on relatively few lakes is that we lack the perspective necessary to formulate general relationships between lakes and their ecological context that hold beyond a single lake or region. As macroscale lake datasets become available, (such as \citet{sorannoLAGOSNEMultiscaledGeospatial2017}, \citet{readWaterQualityData2017}, and \citet{williamsDatabaseGeoreferencedNutrient2017}), we now have the ability to test our intuition and the generality of fine-scale relationships identified in prior studies against hundreds to thousands of lakes at the macroscale.\par

A further limiting factor preventing a fuller consideration of lake ecological context has been lack of data analysis techniques that both account for and leverage spatial variability at broad scales. Such techniques are necessary to account for multiple interacting drivers of the lake ecological status \citep{allanLandscapesRiverscapesInfluence2004}. A key technique, which I use throughout the following chapters, is to build models with regionally varying coefficients that capture different relationships between lake characteristics and landscape predictors depending on geographic region. This technique avoids some of the risk of drawing imprecise or incorrect conclusions due to lumping together lakes with fundamentally different responses to a given predictor variable (Qian et al. 2019). Furthermore, this technique allows for a richer post-hoc examination of model results in light of unobserved or unaccounted regional variation in underlying lake drivers.\par

Given the limiting factors identified above, my aim in this Dissertation was to use the landscape limnology and macrosystems ecology frameworks to more rigorously test conventional understanding of lakes gained from studies at limited spatial extents to a more diverse set of lakes representative of continental-scale gradients through scaling and extrapolation. I developed each chapter following these general steps 1) Identify an aspect of lake ecology that has not been explored at broad spatial extents, 2) Develop a conceptual model linking lake characteristics to different components of the freshwater landscape taking into account variation across spatial scales, and 3) Formulate statistical or machine learning models to test this conceptual model. Underpinning each conceptual model were questions such as: What is the role of local and regional processes and aquatic-terrestrial linkages in determining lake nutrient retention, nutrient concentrations, or basic lake morphometry? and How do relationships between lake nutrient retention, nutrient concentrations and morphology differ when computed over different extents and with different levels of detail?
